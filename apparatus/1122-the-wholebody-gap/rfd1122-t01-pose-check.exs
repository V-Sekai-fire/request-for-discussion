WHAT THE TASK ASKED. RFD 1122's first task is a gate -- of twenty projected poses, how many
would a character artist draw -- and it is on the critical path because a no here redirects
everything after it. It needs no renderer, no GPU and no install.

WHERE THE CLIPS WERE, having been reported missing once. `extract_poses.py` names three
sources and none is in git or in the organisation; they are on the shared drive
`0360 - Datasets Allowlist`. dataset-100style-godot-clips holds 810 glb under CC-BY-4.0 with a
CITATION.cff, which is the first time `mocapClips = 810` has agreed with a file count rather
than with a sentence.

ESSENTIAL TUPLE NORMAL FORM. Clip and bone names are interned once under /T01/Vocab and the
samples carry indices into them, so a name appears in exactly one place. The measurement prims
are satellites rather than nullable columns on the samples. Nothing derivable is stored: there
is no row count, because it is the length of the index arrays; no clip-name column, because
the index resolves it; and no per-clip mean, because the samples are here.

THE PROJECTION WAS WRONG FIRST, AND THE RETRACTION IS UNDER /T01/Findings. A front view was
drawn before anything measured which axis carries the stride.")

bones and every one of these twenty-one names is among them, so a fit that places these leaves

WHY NOT AN AXIS. The first two sheets picked a world axis by hand, and the choice decided the
answer: a front view flattened the stride, and the side view fixed that one dataset while
leaving the same objection standing for the next. The sequence is parameterised by an integer,
so view i of twenty is a yaw and a pitch that nobody argued for and anybody can reproduce.

WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED RATHER THAN GLOSSED. The sequence spans the whole sphere, so view 0 is
pitch -90, straight down. A figure seen from overhead is a legitimate sample of the sphere and
a useless angle for judging whether an artist would draw the pose. That is the generator doing
its job for 3D reconstruction and the wrong job for this gate; picking a band of pitches would
be a decision to record here, not a default to inherit quietly.

Angles are degrees. Parallel to /T01/Vocab/Clips by index, so camera i belongs to clip i."),

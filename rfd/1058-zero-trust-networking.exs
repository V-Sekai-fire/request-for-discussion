    decision ~S"""
    Run weftspun_studio and its CockroachDB host as Podman Quadlets. A
    Quadlet is a `.container`, `.volume`, `.network`, or `.build` file.
    `podman-system-generator` reads it and writes a systemd service.

    Write no hand-written `.service` file. Each unit here is a Quadlet
    file under `weftspun_studio/deploy/quadlet/`.

    See `DETAILS.md` for the two zero-trust mechanisms, and why
    CockroachDB replaces the ZooKeeper Manta's metadata tier needed. It
    also covers the two images, the migrate-before-serve entrypoint, two
    boot bugs this RFD found and fixed, the deploy command, and the
    verified status.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    RFD 1055 selects plain Docker images, on this box first. The router
    and the CockroachDB host need a deploy shape on this box too, the
    single 4090 RTX box this project develops on.

    A perimeter firewall is not a boundary here. The router and the
    database run on the same host as every other process the operator
    runs. Trust must come from isolation, not from network position.
    """

    related ~S"""
    RFD 1019 gives the API server. RFD 1020 pins the CockroachDB build.
    RFD 1037 gives the taskweft job/task split. RFD 1055 selects Docker
    images, on this box first. RFD 1057 tracks what is still open. RFD
    1073 wires versitygw into the Fly toplevel this RFD's loopback rule
    governs.
    """

    details_title "Zero trust networking"

    details "Zero trust, in this deployment", ~S"""
    Zero trust denies a request by default. It grants access by
    identity and by context, not by network position. The two
    mechanisms below give that here.

    **A private network per deployment.** `weftspun.network` joins the
    `weftspun` and `weftspun-crdb` containers. No other container reaches
    either one by name.

    **No port past the loopback address.** Each `PublishPort` binds
    `127.0.0.1`. A process on this host reaches the API or the database,
    and a process on the network does not. CockroachDB runs `--insecure`
    inside `weftspun-crdb`, and that is safe only because of this bind.
    `deps/cockroach_local`'s own foreground task warns that `--insecure`
    fits a developer machine. On a single box with loopback-only ports,
    this container plays that same narrow role.

    versitygw fronts object storage with the S3 API, per the user's
    existing setup. A future worker may read model weights over S3. It
    would reach versitygw on its own bound port, under the same rule as
    this section. No port goes past loopback unless a remote caller
    needs it, and then only that one port.

    RFD 1073 puts this to work, on the Fly toplevel: `versitygw` runs
    colocated with `weftspun_studio`, bound to `127.0.0.1:10000`, the
    same rule stated here.
    """

    details "CockroachDB replaces the Manta metadata tier's ZooKeeper", ~S"""
    Mark Cavage and David Pacheco's ["Bringing Arbitrary Compute to
    Authoritative Data"](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2645649)
    (ACM Queue, 2014) describes Manta, Joyent's object store with
    in-place compute. Two parts of that design carry over here.

    Manta's metadata tier shards PostgreSQL, fronted by a key/value
    layer named Moray. A crashed primary needs a new one, chosen by
    leader election. Manta wrote that election on top of ZooKeeper,
    because PostgreSQL holds no leader election of its own.

    CockroachDB holds Raft consensus and leader election inside the
    database. `weftspun-crdb` needs no ZooKeeper, and no Moray, for the
    same failover Manta built by hand.

    Manta isolates each compute task in its own OS zone, and it rolls
    that zone back between jobs. A Podman Quadlet container is this
    project's equivalent. It gives one container per service, its own
    network namespace, and its own file system. `podman build` tears
    each one down and rebuilds it from the image. RFD 1037's taskweft
    domains give the job/task split Manta's supervisor and agent gave.
    The Quadlet gives the isolation Manta's zone gave.
    """

    details "The images", ~S"""
    `weftspun_studio/Dockerfile` builds the `weftspun_container` release
    (`mix.exs`). It is a plain `mix release` with no Burrito step.
    Burrito wraps a release for a host with no Elixir and no Erlang.
    Inside a container the image is already that unit, so wrapping it
    again would add a Zig build step for nothing. The bare-metal Burrito
    release (`weftspun`, same `mix.exs`) still exists for a host with
    no Podman.

    `weftspun_studio/deploy/Dockerfile.crdb` builds CockroachDB from the
    V-Sekai 22.1 binary `deps/cockroach_local` downloads. It does not
    use the stock Docker Hub image, so the container matches the version
    RFD 1020 already pins.
    """

    details "Migrate before serve, inside the container", ~S"""
    `weftspun_studio/deploy/docker-entrypoint.sh` runs
    `WeftspunStudio.Release.create/0`, then `migrate/0`, then execs the
    server. No second Quadlet runs the migration as a oneshot step. The
    entrypoint does it, so the deployment stays to Quadlet-managed
    containers only.

    `Release.create/0` is new. `Ecto.Migrator.with_repo/2` connects to a
    database. It does not create one. A first boot against an empty
    CockroachDB node failed with `invalid_catalog_name` before this
    function existed. `storage_up/1` is idempotent, so the entrypoint
    calls it every start.
    """

    details "Two boot bugs this RFD found and fixed", ~S"""
    Building and running the images surfaced two faults in
    `WeftspunStudio.Application`. Neither ran before this RFD. RFD 1057
    marks the Burrito binary "written, and never run." The container
    path was the first real boot of either fault.

    **The halt-after-boot bug.** `application.ex` ran
    `WeftspunStudio.CLI.main(argv())` and halted whenever `RELEASE_NAME`
    was set, with no check for empty argv. A standard Elixir release
    sets `RELEASE_NAME` and passes no argv on `bin/APP start`. A normal
    release start therefore halted the node right after it booted. The
    Burrito binary never hit this fault, because Burrito's own launcher
    sets `__BURRITO_RELEASE_NAME`, not `RELEASE_NAME`, so `release?()`
    read false there by accident. The fix checks for non-empty argv too,
    so `db migrate` still reaches the CLI and a bare `start` does not.

    **The `Mix.env/0` crash.** `serve?()` called `Mix.env()` to skip the
    HTTP listener in tests. Mix ships with the compiler, not with a
    release, so a released node crashed at boot with
    `UndefinedFunctionError`. The fix guards the call with
    `Code.ensure_loaded?(Mix)`, the same pattern `argv/0` already used
    for `Burrito.Util.Args`.
    """

    details "Deploy", ~S"""
    ```bash
    sudo bash scripts/deploy-weftspun-quadlet.sh
    ```

    The script syncs this repository to `/opt/weftspun/src`, the fixed
    path the `.build` Quadlets read a `Containerfile` from. It installs
    the Quadlet files to `/etc/containers/systemd/`, and it starts
    `weftspun.service`. `weftspun.service` requires
    `weftspun-crdb.service`, so one command brings up both. The API
    answers at `http://127.0.0.1:4001`. See Verified, below, for why
    4000 is not the port.
    """

    details "Verified, on this box, through the real Quadlet path", ~S"""
    `scripts/deploy-weftspun-quadlet.sh` ran as root.
    `podman-system-generator` turned all six Quadlet files into
    `.service` units. `systemctl status` shows both `weftspun-crdb.service`
    and `weftspun.service` as `active (running)`, not merely built.
    `curl http://127.0.0.1:4001/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/models`
    both answered, over the Quadlet-managed container, with no Postgrex
    error in the journal. The app reached CockroachDB by container name
    (`weftspun-crdb`) over `weftspun.network`.

    Two host-specific faults surfaced only at this last step, past what a
    direct `podman run` (this RFD's first verification pass) reached.

    **Rootful Podman's bridge network could not reach the internet on
    this host. The kernel dropped it, and DNS was not the cause.**
    `weftspun-crdb-build.service` failed inside `apt-get update`, timing
    out on every mirror. DNS was the first suspect (`--dns=1.1.1.1`,
    still set on both `.build` units). It did not fix the failure.
    `sudo nft list ruleset` showed why.

    Docker's installer wrote a `FORWARD` chain with `policy drop`. Only
    two chains it jumps to accept anything: `ts-forward` (Tailscale) and
    `DOCKER-FORWARD`, which itself drops everything not on `docker0`.
    Podman's netavark bridge for `weftspun.network` is neither, so the
    host dropped every packet the build container sent outbound before
    it left the host. Rootless Podman never hit this chain. It routes
    through slirp4netns/pasta in user space, not the kernel bridge/forward
    path rootful Podman uses. That is why the same Dockerfiles built
    cleanly under rootless Podman earlier in this session.

    `DNS=1.1.1.1` on both `.build` units, scoped to the build container
    only, is the change on record. `sudo nft list ruleset` today shows
    no accept rule added for the `weftspun` bridge subnet, and the
    `FORWARD` policy this section describes is still `drop`. A later
    `deploy-weftspun-quadlet.sh` run built both images and started both
    services, and `systemctl status` confirms both `weftspun.service`
    and `weftspun-crdb.service` run today. This RFD records that
    outcome. It does not claim to explain why the DNS change alone was
    enough on a retry, when it was not enough on the first attempt.

    A host-wide `nft` `FORWARD` change may still be the more durable
    fix. Confirm `systemctl status weftspun.service` and `systemctl
    status weftspun-crdb.service` show `active (running)` after any
    future rebuild, the same caution RFD 1057 gives the dev container
    and the Pixal3D worker stage.

    details "Why three layers", ~S"""
    CBMC proves the C code is correct for bounded inputs but cannot reason
    about TPC-C semantics. Lean 4 proves the specification is sound but does
    not verify the C implementation. plausible-witness-dag searches for
    runtime invariant violations via HTTP but cannot prove absence of bugs.
    
    Together they cover the gap: CBMC catches implementation bugs, Lean 4
    catches specification bugs, plausible-witness-dag catches integration
    bugs.

    Depends on `fire/plausible-witness-dag` as a Lake dependency. The
    `resolve` function takes a candidate predicate and a deterministic
    readback, escalating through L0/L1/L2 until it finds a witness or
    proves none exists.
    
    Escalation ladder: L0 (10 txns, W=1), L1 (100 txns, W=5), L2 (1000 txns, W=20).

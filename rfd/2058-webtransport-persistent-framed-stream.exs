    """

    details "Decision drivers", ~S"""
    - A client sends a transform every tick and a control event rarely, so
      the reliable path takes a high message rate.
    - picoquic caps concurrent streams per connection, and the
      extended-CONNECT response rides the session's control stream.
    - The same `set_transfer_channel` plus `set_transfer_mode` lane
      selection has to read the same on both transports.
    """

    details "Considered options", ~S"""
    - A fresh bidirectional stream per reliable message, FIN'd after the
      payload.
    - One persistent bidirectional stream per session, carrying
      length-prefixed frames.
    """

    details "Decision outcome", ~S"""
    Chosen option: reliable traffic rides one persistent bidirectional
    WebTransport stream per session, opened once after connect-accepted
    and appended to without a per-message FIN; unreliable traffic rides
    datagrams. Each reliable message carries the webtransportd frame
    header (`flag | len_varint | payload`, where the flag holds a 0–7
    channel and a reliable bit), so the receiver delimits messages on the
    shared stream and recovers the channel. This matches the picoquic
    `wt_baton` reference and the webtransportd frame spec.

    A fresh stream per message exhausts the connection's stream credit,
    and the exhaustion starves the connect-accepted response on the
    control stream, so the late session stays in connecting. The
    persistent stream holds the stream count at one per session regardless
    of message rate.

    Five supporting invariants keep the server alive under concurrent
    load:

    - The inbound packet queue takes a mutex shared by the picoquic
      network thread and the main thread. A Lean+Plausible model proves
      the locked queue stays size-honest for every schedule, and finds the
      unlocked interleaving that strands the newest session's packets
      behind a stale cached length.
    - The packet-loop wake branch services receive and send on the same
      iteration, and the work queue drains on every loop callback,
      including timeouts and receives. A steady wake stream otherwise
      holds the loop in the wake branch and starves both directions. The
      same Lean+Plausible model proves the inclusive iteration stays
      starvation-free for every schedule.
    - `get_packet_peer`, `get_packet_mode`, and `get_packet_channel` peek
      the front of the queue, the MultiplayerPeer contract, rather than
      the last-popped value. Reading the popped value mis-attributes
      interleaved sessions, so a late client's join credits another peer
      and the client never receives its welcome.
    - The server connection table sizes for the entity and interest
      fanout, above a single slot.
    - The picoquic textlog stays behind the engine verbose flag, because
      its synchronous stdout writes stall the network thread under load.
    """

    details "Consequences", ~S"""
    - A client opens one reliable stream for its whole session, so
      concurrent joins keep their stream credit and reach open.
    - The channel-plus-reliability flag the ENet peer reads from the
      transfer channel and mode rides inside the frame, so both transports
      realize the channels decision with one mental model.
    - The slice runs identically on `TRANSPORT=enet` and `TRANSPORT=wt`;
      the text protocol stays transport-agnostic across both.
    """

    details "Confirmation", ~S"""
    The [http3-queue](https://github.com/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/http3-queue)
    Lean+Plausible workspace proves the queue and wake-loop properties and
    exhibits the failing schedules. Five concurrent WebTransport sessions
    stay healthy for ninety seconds and complete full Hub-to-Field-to-Loot
    rounds, on the fork's `feat/module-http3`.

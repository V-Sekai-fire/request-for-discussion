    scope "`rfd/1122-the-wholebody-gap`"

    decision ~S"""
    Retract RFD 1122 (wholebody detector); keep its renderer-first rule and let successor RFDs carry deployment. RFD 1122 moves to `abandoned` alongside this document landing.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    RFD 1122 proposed rendering ANNY (the reference rig) to train a 104-point keypoint detector, then deploying it. RFD 1143 (propose-score loop, published), RFD 1168 (layer segmentation, ideation), and RFD 1173 (edit-reward corpus, discussion) settled the deployment differently, so RFD 1122's `discussion` state stopped tracking reality.
    """

    section "What survives", ~S"""
    - Renderer-first, RFD 1122 rule 1. ANNY is posed and photographed; joints come out of camera arithmetic. RFD 1143 uses it as the render leg of its propose loop.
    - Two-scorer discipline. RFD 1143 committed EditScore plus Referee, because a fit that looks right while the joints are wrong passes the first alone.
    - Renderer as comparison, not detector target. RFD 1173's MaskScore (edit-reward corpus) scores generations by comparing renders to targets. No 104-point head trains on the renders.

    Retracted: train a 104-point head on rendered ANNY (RFD 1168 moves layer segmentation into the 3D latent via rf-detr-Seg), and the wholebody-detector deployment premise. ANNY is the pose primitive throughout, propose through score.

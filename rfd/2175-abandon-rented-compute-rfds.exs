    decision ~S"""
    Abandon five RFDs (1132, 1140, 1163, 2133, 2138) whose decisions name RunPod or Vast.ai rented compute, which CLAUDE.md's hard constraint now blocklists. Each moves to `abandoned` alongside this document landing.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    CLAUDE.md's hard constraint is "the local desktop GPU is the only compute; RunPod and Vast.ai blocklisted". Five open RFDs still name rented compute as their decision, so the RFD's whole reason for existing contradicts the blocklist. The RFDs themselves stay in the register for citation, per CLAUDE.md's "retractions stay in place next to what they retract".
    """

    section "The five", ~S"""
      RFD 1140  Rented GPUs on RunPod. Decision 'rented GPU work runs
                on RunPod' contradicts CLAUDE.md's RunPod blocklist.
      RFD 1132  Priority list of converted models. RunPod as serving
                interactor. Same contradiction.
      RFD 1163  The accelerator in the loops. 'flow runs on RunPod'.
      RFD 2133  The pool rents from the spot book. 'Rent single
                RTX 4090s from the vast.ai book'.
      RFD 2138  interactor-shuttle. Merges the spot-broker whose whole
                reason was renting vast.ai. Abandoned with 2133.

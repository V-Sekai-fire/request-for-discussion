    scope "every `.md`, `.qmd`, and code-comment file in the workspace"

    decision ~S"""
    Prose in this workspace states what is currently true of the system; every sentence describes behaviour a reader can check against the code in front of them.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    Comments and prose drift out of sync with code as the system changes. A comment written as history ("added a cache", "we removed the old path") or as a plan ("will solve this", "TODO: wire X") describes a moment that has passed or has not yet arrived; a reader cannot check it against the code in front of them. RFD 2025 (sinew voice ADR, migrated) settled the rule; this RFD promotes it to a workspace convention.
    """

    section "Three habits ruled out", ~S"""
    - Past-tense edit narration ("removed the legacy path"). Git holds history.
    - Future or imperative planning ("will add", "TODO"). RFDs and issues hold plans.
    - Aging temporal qualifiers ("now", "currently", "previously"). A qualifier that goes stale on the next edit signals the sentence should have described a truth.

    Unfinished areas read as present gaps ("the parser handles no Unicode escapes yet"), not as tasks. A stale sentence signals a real divergence from the code, which makes review catch it.

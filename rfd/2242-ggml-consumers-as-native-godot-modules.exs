    decision ~S"""
    Operator, 2026-09-09, verbatim: *"consolidate so that each of
    the ggml users is a godot engine c++ module on top of
    entities-godot master. you probably want to stack the code on
    top of a ggml module"*.

    Reverses the arrangement RFD 2230 was proposing (single native
    module + GDScript adapters). Everything is native C++, stacked
    at the `#include` and link level, no GDScript layer between
    consumer code and ggml.

    details "What each related RFD contributes", ~S"""

    - RFD 2188 (one ggml across workspace), the source
      consolidation this RFD builds on. `modules/ggml/#thirdparty/`
      vendors `2-contract/ggml` at the workspace's canonical
      revision.
    - RFD 2211 (base tree entities-godot-sandbox), the tree the
      new modules land in. Base branch is Godot upstream `master`
      per the operator's directive, not the current
      `main` / `multiplayer-fabric` line.
    - RFD 2229 (interchangeable-parts policy), the policy this
      RFD lands one of. `check_manifest_dupes.exs` goes green
      when every consumer's private ggml submount is replaced by
      the shared `modules/ggml/#thirdparty/ggml/`.
    - RFD 2230 (ggml adapters as sandboxed GDScript), retracted
      by this RFD's decision. 2230's Layer-1 (native `modules/ggml/`)
      survives as this RFD's foundation module; its Layer-2 and
      Layer-3 (GDScript adapters) do not.
    - RFD 2212 (motion-bricks-as-native-godot-module), the
      earlier per-consumer-native-module shape this RFD reinstates
      as one leaf of the tree.
    - `turboquant-godot/modules/llm/`, the existing reference
      implementation of a native ggml-wrapping Godot module (ggml
      + llama.cpp + Metal/Vulkan/WebGPU builders). Seed for
      `modules/ggml/`; the llama.cpp portion moves to a separate
      `modules/llama_cpp/` in a follow-up.
    - `entities-godot-sandbox/modules/cineform/`, the reference
      template for a downstream consumer module. Vendored
      `#thirdparty/` + `env_thirdparty.add_source_files` +
      per-clone warning suppression.
    """

    details "The arrangement", ~S"""
    Six modules in `entities-godot-sandbox/modules/`, layered:

        modules/ggml/                     ← foundation. Vendors ggml.
        modules/motion_bricks/            ← stacks on modules/ggml
        modules/skin_tokens/              ← stacks on modules/ggml
        modules/pixal3d/                  ← stacks on modules/ggml
        modules/kimodo/                   ← stacks on modules/ggml
        modules/rf_detr/                  ← stacks on modules/ggml

    Stacking is at the C++ level: consumer modules `#include
    "modules/ggml/ggml_engine.h"` and link against Godot's
    all-modules-together binary. No SCsub-level `Depends` between
    modules, matching the `multiplayer_fabric_asset` →
    `multiplayer_fabric` precedent already in the tree.

    Every module has the shape SCsub + config.py + register_types.
    {h,cpp} + module code + `#thirdparty/<name>/` vendored sources.
    `modules/ggml/` registers at `MODULE_REGISTRATION_LEVEL_CORE`;
    every consumer registers at `MODULE_REGISTRATION_LEVEL_SCENE`.
    """

    details "Why native C++ and not GDScript adapters", ~S"""
    RFD 2230 argued for GDScript adapters. That shape trades
    performance and type-safety for run-time swappability, and
    swappability is not the property the atelier's runtime needs.
    Every consumer here already has a stable C ABI
    (`motionbricks.h`, `skintokens.h`, `kimodo_capi.h`,
    `trellis2_capi.h`), so wrapping them into a Godot Resource is
    a mechanical port with type-checked signatures; a GDScript
    adapter reintroduces a dynamic-typed layer that does nothing
    the C ABI does not already do.

    The one exception is `rf-detr-cpp`, which does not have a C
    ABI yet — its public surface is C++ classes with `ggml_tensor*`
    on the signatures. Adding `rfdetr_capi.{h,cpp}` upstream in
    `rf-detr-cpp` is the missing precondition, and lands as its
    own PR ahead of `modules/rf_detr/`.
    """

    details "Interchangeable-parts obligation", ~S"""
    RFD 2229 requires every new component to name what it
    substitutes for.

    - `modules/ggml/` substitutes for `2-contract/ggml`'s
      standalone CMake build and for every consumer's private
      `ggml/` submount.
    - `modules/motion_bricks/` substitutes for
      `3-interactor/motion-bricks-cpp/`'s standalone CMake project.
      The source-of-truth code stays in the standalone repo;
      `modules/motion_bricks/#thirdparty/motion_bricks/` vendors
      it via `scripts/import_module_source.py`.
    - Same substitution shape for `skin_tokens`, `pixal3d`,
      `kimodo`, `rf_detr`.
    - `turboquant-godot/modules/llm/` gets a retraction PR after
      `modules/ggml/` lands, pointing at
      `entities-godot-sandbox/modules/ggml/`.

    Not substituted (out of scope): `nx-ggml` (Elixir NIF, not a
    Godot module), `transport-shepherd` (Elixir gate that
    references ggml.h only), `stable-diffusion.cpp` (pins its own
    older ggml SHA, RFD 2188 already scoped it out),
    `entities-gyre` (empty directory).
    """

    details "Sequencing", ~S"""
    1. This RFD lands `:discussion`. RFD 2230 flips to
       `:abandoned` with a one-line pointer here.
    2. `V-Sekai-fire/rf-detr-cpp` PR adds `rfdetr_capi.{h,cpp}`.
       Nothing else consumes rf-detr yet, so this ships alone
       against `master`.
    3. `V-Sekai-fire/entities-godot-sandbox` new branch
       `ggml-consolidation` off Godot upstream `master`. Adds
       `modules/ggml/` seeded from `turboquant-godot/modules/llm/`,
       minus the llama.cpp portion and minus
       `resource_importer_gguf.{cpp,h}` (return in a follow-up).
    4. Same branch adds the five consumer modules, each with a
       minimal Resource stub over their C ABI. Full
       feature-parity per consumer lands in follow-up PRs.
    5. `weftspun-keypoint/default.xml` drops
       `3-interactor/skin-tokens-cpp/ggml` (the last remaining
       ggml submount) and, optionally, the five consumer project
       entries whose code is now vendored inside modules.
       `check_manifest_dupes.exs` exits 0.
    6. `turboquant-godot/modules/llm/` retraction PR points at
       `entities-godot-sandbox/modules/ggml/`.
    """

    details "Verification", ~S"""
    1. `scons --dry-run p=macos target=editor` on the new branch
       parses every new module's SCsub without a build. Runs in
       seconds; catches SCsub-level syntax errors and missing
       source files.
    2. Full `scons p=macos target=editor tools=yes dev_build=yes`
       compiles the engine with all new modules enabled. First
       pass takes tens of minutes per module with sccache cold.
       Runs in CI, admin-merge past initial red if item 1 is
       green.
    3. `ClassDB.class_get_method_list("MotionBricksModel")` and
       equivalents in a running editor instance confirm the
       modules register real Godot classes and not empty stubs.
    4. `elixir check_manifest_dupes.exs --manifest default.xml`
       exits 0 after step 5 of Sequencing.

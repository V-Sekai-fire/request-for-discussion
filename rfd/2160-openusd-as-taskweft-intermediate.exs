    Adopt **OpenUSD `.usda`** as the plan's canonical form. CLAUDE.md
    blesses it ("OpenUSD `.usda` if we want to remain text editable";
    zip/gz blocklisted). USD gives hierarchical Prims, typed attributes,
    references + layer composition (native bidirectional shape), and
    asset refs for binary payloads.

    `DETAILS.md` carries the full text of this RFD.

    Each emitter reads PLCopen FBD XML and writes its own format.
    Nothing carries all of them side-by-side. RFD 2159's differential
    (C++ vs Rust ELFs) needs a place to store both outputs alongside
    the input FBD so a checker cross-verifies.

    Prim shape per plan: `/Plan/{Domain, Problem, Network, Deliveries,
    Provenance}`. Under `/Deliveries`, two platforms only:
    1. **Godot**: `ElfCpp` / `ElfRust` (asset refs, RFD 2159 cross-check)
    2. **VRChat**: `UdonAsm` (inline Udon assembly)
    Plus `PLCopenXML` (inline XML, source of truth) and optional
    `GDScript` (inline `.gd`). `/Provenance`: emitter versions, hashes,
    timestamps.

    RFD 2159's differential reads `ElfCpp` and `ElfRust` and diffs.
    RFD 2153 writes `UdonAsm`. RFD 2154 loads `ElfCpp`. All emitters
    become USD writers; all consumers USD readers.

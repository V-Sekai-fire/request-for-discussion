    decision ~S"""
    Author domains as compact IEC 60848 GRAFCET (SFC-shaped notation) in
    a JSON-LD profile aligned with Project-AGRAFE. A taskweft mix task
    lowers into the HTN JSON the NIF loader consumes. The authoring
    shape is GRAFCET; the *runtime target* under RFD 2150 is IEC
    61131-3 **FBD** (SFC as a runtime target is blocklisted). The mapping is
    total on the AND/sequential fragment; `|>`, `|<`, `!>`, `%`, `#`
    markers extend it to OR-divergence, macro-steps, enclosing steps, and
    forcing orders. Those higher-level 60848 constructs cover HTN
    parameter dispatch and method decomposition without leaving the
    standard. `DETAILS.md` carries the mapping table, the loss ledger,
    the transport, the persona rate contract, and the verification.
    
    `DETAILS.md` carries the full text of this RFD.

    Every construct is a 60848 element under a short local name, expanded
    by JSON-LD `@context` to the AGRAFE IRIs so the same file round-trips
    into their model without a second document.
    
    Steps are entries in an ordered `S` array; position implies a `Link`
    to the next entry unless a divergence intervenes. Sigils at position
    zero mark the step kind: `""` or omitted = `Step`, `^` = `InitialStep`,
    `%` = `MacroStep`, `#` = `EnclosingStep`. Divergence markers are their
    own entries: `&>` opens an `AndDivergence` to the named siblings,
    `&<` closes an `AndConvergence` from the named steps into the next
    entry; `|>` / `|<` are the OR forms; `!>` is a `ForcingOrder` writing
    another chart's marking. Per step: `[name, when, do, t]`; `when` is
    the transition's `Receptivity` (boolean expression over `X.<step>`
    step activities and `V.<var>` internal variables), `do` is a stored
    `Action` (assignment or emit), `t` is the transition's time delay.
    
    The reference file, `.github/plans/weftspun-build.grafcet.jsonld`, is
    13 lines of `S` against the 38 lines of hand-authored HTN it lowers to.

    details "The mapping table, in full", ~S"""
    Every taskweft feature lands on one 60848 construct. Nothing on the
    right extends the standard.
    
    | taskweft feature | IEC 60848 construct |
    |---|---|
    | boolean state flag | step activity `X_i` or internal boolean |
    | action's `pointer/set` on a flag | `Step` with `stored` action |
    | guard `math/eq` over a flag | `Receptivity` on the upstream transition |
    | sequential subtasks | `Link` chain |
    | fan-in / fan-out | AND-convergence / AND-divergence |
    | `duration: "PT1H"` on an action | `timeDelayed` receptivity `t/X_i/1h` |
    | single-alternative skip-if-done method | subsumed by step activity |
    | parameterised action, finite static domain | grounded via `MacroStep` template with `for` field |
    | parameterised action, domain known at plan time | internal variables + dispatch pattern |
    | method with N receptivity-selected alternatives | `OrDivergence` with N exclusive receptivities |
    | method with N search-selected alternatives | `ForcingOrder` rewinds the sub-chart on downstream failure |
    | task-network goal | `InitialStep` marking + terminal `EnclosingStep` |
    | HTN decomposition hierarchy | `MacroStep` per method |
    | ETNF tuple state, ref into `capabilities` | interned integer id in an internal variable |
    | plan trace with bindings | firing trace with timestamps |
    
    The **grounding-scale gate** in `Taskweft.Grafcet` refuses any lowering
    that would produce more than N ground steps for a `%macro`-with-`for`;
    the author moves it to the dispatch-variable pattern instead. This is
    what keeps "no HTN feature lost" from turning into "unreadable chart".
    """

    details "Round-trip semantics", ~S"""
    `raise(lower(g)) == g` when `g` is canonical; `lower(raise(h))` is
    idempotent for any well-formed `h`. Canonicalisation drops
    transitively-redundant guards: the reference HTN gates `a_oracle` on
    `/done/lake` although `ingest`, `embedder`, and `slat` each already
    gate on `lake`. The compact form drops those inherited receptivities;
    the second pass is a fixed point. `mix test test/taskweft/grafcet_test.exs`
    under `3-interactor/taskweft` passes 4/4, exercising both directions.
    """

    details "Transport: `2-contract/bus` + CBOR + zstd", ~S"""
    Stdio JSON is **blocklisted** for the Elixir↔Python wire when the
    peer is a language-external library (nmm2 here). The workspace's
    canonical transport is `2-contract/bus`'s DYNAMIC byte-slice command
    bus (iceoryx2 shared memory, 8-byte request-id envelope). Python
    reuses `weft_harness.Bus`'s `serve` loop verbatim; Elixir speaks the
    same wire through a new NIF at
    `3-interactor/taskweft-nmm-personas/c_src/weft_bus_nif.cpp`, modelled
    on `spot_broker/c_src/store_bus_nif.cpp` + `bus/proof/command_publisher.cpp`.
    
    The bus caps at 128 KiB per message. The projected 128-agent nmm2
    obs is 1,233,911 bytes as JSON, 433,346 as CBOR, and **4,821 bytes
    as CBOR+zstd**; 250× smaller than JSON, well under the ceiling. Both
    sides speak the same envelope: 1-byte tag (`Z` = zstd-compressed CBOR,
    `C` = plain CBOR) followed by the body. Python uses `cbor2` + `zstandard`;
    Elixir uses `:cbor` + `:ezstd`.
    
    An obs that outgrows even zstd should move to a Snapshot pub/sub on
    its own service, coordinated by the command bus. The bus README's
    own recommendation for bulk payloads. Not needed yet.
    """

    details "Continuous-time scheduling", ~S"""
    Personas run in real time, not turn-based. Two independent wall-clock
    loops via `TaskweftNmmPersonas.Scheduler`:
    `:timer.send_interval(persona_period_ms, :persona_tick)` refreshes
    each agent's latest intended action into an ETS mailbox at
    `--persona-hz` Hz; a second timer at `--env-hz` reads the latest
    fragments and steps the env. Only the last intended action per agent
    between env steps is submitted. Both rates are fixed integer Hz. No
    elastic scheduling.
    
    `persona_hz >= 10` is a hard contract; the Scheduler raises
    `ArgumentError` below it. Effective rates are recorded per episode
    and per trace row (`wall_us` monotonic timestamp).
    
    Measured on a live 128-agent nmm2 episode, target 30/10 Hz:
    
        persona 26.14 Hz (target 30), env 8.2 Hz (target 10), 1.951s
    
    BEAM `send_interval` jitters ~10-20% under real work; target above
    the floor with headroom, not at it. Three `mix test` cases guard this:
    one asserts effective persona rate ≥10 Hz on a real episode, one
    asserts the Scheduler refuses `persona_hz < 10`, one exercises the
    MaskScore row shape.
    """

    details "MaskScore row shape", ~S"""
    One row per (persona, episode, dimension). Field names track the
    EditScore schema in RFD 1173's MASKSCORE.md verbatim:
    
    | field | meaning |
    |---|---|
    | `key` | `nmm2_{persona}_seed{S}_ep{N}_{hash}`; stable, dedup-safe |
    | `instruction` | "play Neural MMO 2 as a {persona} persona for N ticks" |
    | `input_state` | `seed={S}` |
    | `conditioning_image` | null |
    | `output_traces` | list of per-tick JSONL shard paths |
    | `scores` | `[survival_fraction, avg_health_norm]` |
    | `task_type` | `survive` |
    | `dimension` | `instruction_following` / `consistency` / `overall` |
    
    Scores are populated by game-native reductions of the trace itself,
    not by Mitsuba render-and-compare. The RFD 1173 metric doesn't apply
    to a text-shaped game; the schema stays faithful (same fields, same
    three dimensions), the *content* of `scores` is the domain-specific
    reduction. A future generator that produces game-shaped outputs would
    plug directly into the same schema.
    """

    details "The three personas", ~S"""
    Each persona is one `.grafcet.jsonld` file under `personas/`. Steps
    resolve to Elixir dispatch functions in
    `lib/taskweft_nmm_personas/persona.ex` that consume the current
    observation, mutate persona memory, and return an action fragment.
    
    | persona | step chain |
    |---|---|
    | forager | sense → seek_water → gather_food → wander → end_turn |
    | hunter | sense → heal_or_flee → seek_target → attack_or_move → end_turn |
    | trader | sense → sell_surplus → buy_cheap → wander → end_turn |
    
    Persona differentiation lives entirely in the step list. Adding a
    persona is one new `*.grafcet.jsonld` file plus (if it introduces new
    step names) new entries in the dispatch table.
    """

    details "The higher-level constructs are in scope", ~S"""
    Scope of the DSL is whatever taskweft's HTN can express. Every
    construct taskweft uses today rounds-trips through the lowering
    compiler; anything else stays out of the DSL.
    
    taskweft's HTN uses parameterised actions (`params: [:block]`),
    methods with N alternatives selected by `check` clauses, method
    decomposition, and task-network goals. Those land on the following
    60848 constructs, staged by build order:
    
    1. `|>` / `|<` (`OrDivergence` / `OrConvergence`) for a method with N
       receptivity-selected alternatives. **Implemented.** Round-trip
       test in `taskweft/test/taskweft/grafcet_test.exs` exercises a
       two-alternative fixture.
    2. `%macro` (`MacroStep`) for method decomposition and parameter
       grounding over a finite static domain. Staged next.
    3. `#enclosing` (`EnclosingStep`) for a task-network goal or a
       macro-scoped sub-plan. Staged after `%macro`.
    4. `!>` (`ForcingOrder`) for HTN backtracking on downstream failure
       of a chosen alternative. Staged last; harder to make round-trip
       idempotent because the rewound branch can be authored two ways.
    
    Each staged construct ships with its own round-trip test and its own
    worked fixture. The grounding-scale gate applies to `%macro` with
    `for`.
    """

    details "What is deliberately not here", ~S"""
    1. RL training. Personas are hand-authored SFCs; the traces populate
      a reward-model dataset, they do not train the personas.
    2. A wall-clock scheduler that varies the persona rate at runtime. The
      contract is stable Hz, no jitter.
    3. Bulk-payload transport. Obs stays under 128 KiB via CBOR+zstd; a
      Snapshot pub/sub is the next-step answer if that budget is ever
      exceeded.
    """

    details "Verification", ~S"""
    1. `mix test` in `3-interactor/taskweft/`; 4/4, the compact GRAFCET
      round-trip on `weftspun-build.grafcet.jsonld` and canonicalisation
      on `weftspun-build.domain.jsonld`.
    2. `mix test` in `3-interactor/taskweft-nmm-personas/`; 3/3, the
      MaskScore row count, the persona rate floor, the Scheduler refusal.
    3. Live episode over `2-contract/bus` with real 128-agent nmm2:
      `ep0 seed42: persona 26.14 Hz (target 30), env 8.2 Hz (target 10),
      1.951s` and `9 MaskScore rows -> traces/maskscore.jsonl`.
    4. The traces are `traces/maskscore.jsonl` + `traces/maskscore.parquet`
      (parquet via duckdb reading the JSONL sibling; no pyarrow dep).

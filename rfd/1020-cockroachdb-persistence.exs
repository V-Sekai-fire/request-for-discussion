    **Use SQLite for storage, and Ecto for the mapping.** Each service owns one file.
    `Ecto.Adapters.SQLite3` drives it through `ecto_sqlite3`.

    The problem above is unchanged. Catalog facts must survive a restart, and an Agent rebuilt at
    every boot loses a retraction. Only the store changed.

    Ecto and the natural keys carried over. The cluster and `migration_lock: false` left.

    """

    problem ~S"""
    RFD 1019 builds an API server. An API server must keep its data.

    The fact store in `WeftspunStudio.FactStore` holds facts in memory.
    An Agent rebuilds the store from the RFD 1016 inventory at every
    boot. A trust change dies when the node stops, and a retracted fact
    comes back.

    RFD 1016 records that catalog facts change fast. A license gate
    vetoes a model, a benchmark moves a recommendation, and a backend
    drops a model. The store must keep those changes.

    """

    details "Retracted on 2026-08-20: the CockroachDB decision", ~S"""
    The decision this RFD published is withdrawn. It stays written here, because it records what
    was true and because most of it carried over.

        Use the V-Sekai CockroachDB build for storage, and Ecto for the
        mapping. The V-Sekai build lives at
        `https://github.com/v-sekai/cockroach`, from the Oxide Computer
        build of CockroachDB 22.1. The project already depends on that build
        elsewhere, so the same build keeps one database version across the
        work.

        CockroachDB speaks the PostgreSQL wire protocol. Ecto drives it
        through `Ecto.Adapters.Postgres`, and no separate adapter is
        necessary.

    RFD 1067 reranked CockroachDB against FoundationDB and kept it. That RFD is now abandoned, and
    `weftspun/cockroach-local` is archived and out of `default.xml`, so this decision pointed at a
    repository that no longer takes changes.
    """

    details "What carried over", ~S"""
    Ecto carried over, and so did the mapping. The move is an adapter swap.

    The natural keys carried over, and the reason changed. This RFD adopted them because
    CockroachDB gives no gap free `SERIAL`. They stay because a catalog fact has a natural key, so
    an integer id would be a second name for the same row.
    """

    details "What left", ~S"""
    `migration_lock: false` left. This RFD names it as a constraint, because CockroachDB has no
    PostgreSQL advisory lock. That constraint went with the database.

    The cluster left. `mix weftspun.crdb` is deleted, 104 lines that installed a binary, started a
    node and stopped it. The `cockroach_local` dependency is gone from every `mix.exs`.
    """

    details "The risks, revisited", ~S"""
    This RFD named three. Two are answered and one is not.

    **"CockroachDB 22.1 is old."** It called a version move a separate decision. That decision
    arrived as a different one, and the risk is now spent rather than resolved.

    **"The suite needs a running cluster."** It recorded that a developer without one sees 16
    failures. A file needs no server, so that is gone. `weftspun-studio` now runs 110 tests with
    two failures, and neither touches the database.

    **"A second store is a second source of truth."** Unchanged. The HTTP surface still reads the
    in-memory store, so the two can still drift, and pointing the router at `EctoFactStore` is
    still the next step. Changing the engine did not address it.
    """

    details "Evidence", ~S"""
    Three merged changes rather than an intention. `weftspun-studio` and
    `weftspun-character-taxonomy` both moved, and `cockroach-local` is archived.

    One claim was checked rather than assumed, because an earlier draft of this amendment had it
    backwards. The `facts` table carries `tags` as `{:array, :string}`, and SQLite takes it:
    `ecto_sqlite3` stores an array as JSON, and it round-trips and queries through `json_each`. No
    schema change was needed, and a retraction claiming otherwise would have invented a migration.
    """

    details "Scope", ~S"""
    This RFD covers `weftspun_studio/`. `character_taxonomy/` runs under RFD 1065 and moved in the
    same sweep, for the same reason.

    ### Why CockroachDB

    **Retracted.** The reasons below are sound and stopped applying. "One API server or many" was
    the argument, and the load never grew into it. RFD 1067 measured the same thing from the other
    side and kept CockroachDB anyway, and that RFD is now abandoned too.

    CockroachDB gives one API server or many. A single node runs on a
    developer machine. The same binary joins a cluster later. The API
    server therefore grows without a database migration.

    The wire protocol is the PostgreSQL protocol. A developer who knows
    `psql` needs no new tool.

    ### Two constraints

    **One left, one stayed.** `migration_lock: false` went with the database, because it existed
    for CockroachDB's missing advisory lock. The natural keys stayed, for a better reason than the
    one below: a catalog fact has a natural key, so an integer id would be a second name for the
    same row.

    CockroachDB has no PostgreSQL advisory lock. The Ecto migrator takes
    such a lock by default. Every repository configuration therefore sets
    `migration_lock: false`.

    CockroachDB gives no gap free integer sequence. A `SERIAL` column
    returns large scattered numbers. The `facts` table therefore uses the
    model id as the primary key. A catalog fact already has a natural
    key, so this costs nothing.
    """

    details "The facts table", ~S"""
    **Unchanged.** Every type here is portable, including `tags`. `ecto_sqlite3` stores an array as
    JSON, and it round-trips and queries through `json_each`, which was measured rather than
    assumed.

    | Column        | Type          | Holds                                            |
    | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | `fact_id`     | `string`      | The model id. Primary key.                       |
    | `content`     | `text`        | The label or the task text.                      |
    | `category`    | `string`      | The client feature, such as `image_to_raw_mesh`. |
    | `tags`        | `string[]`    | Type, host, and status.                          |
    | `trust_score` | `float`       | Zero to one. Feedback moves it.                  |
    | `hrr_vector`  | `bytea`       | The packed float64 phase vector.                 |
    | `inserted_at` | `timestamptz` | Row creation time.                               |
    | `updated_at`  | `timestamptz` | Last change time.                                |

    The shape follows the hermes-agent holographic memory store, as RFD
    1019 records.

    `hrr_vector` holds the output of
    `WeftspunStudio.FactVector.encode/2` as a packed binary. The width is
    fixed at 1024 float64 phase angles, so a row takes 8 kilobytes. The
    changeset derives the vector from the other columns. No caller
    supplies it. A row therefore cannot hold a vector that disagrees with
    its fields. RFD 1021 records the encoding.

    Search reads the candidate rows and scores them in Nx. The database
    applies the trust floor first. A phase similarity over a packed
    tensor has no SQL form in CockroachDB 22.1, so the algebra stays in
    Elixir.
    """

    details "The seed database", ~S"""
    The RFD 1016 inventory is the seed, not a fixed table.
    `WeftspunStudio.Adapters.EctoFactStore.seed/0` writes it once. A
    second run refreshes the same rows and adds no duplicate, because the
    model id is the primary key.

    After the seed the database is the record. Feedback moves a trust
    score. A retraction deletes a row. The seed never overwrites those
    later changes for a fact it does not name.
    """

    details "Modules", ~S"""
    | Module                                  | Role                                      |
    | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
    | `WeftspunStudio.Repo`                   | The connection pool.                      |
    | `WeftspunStudio.Facts.Fact`             | The schema and the changeset.             |
    | `WeftspunStudio.Adapters.EctoFactStore` | A `Ports.FactSink` adapter.               |
    | `WeftspunStudio.Release`                | Migration and seed for a packaged binary. |

    `EctoFactStore` is the durable twin of `FactStore`. Both implement
    `WeftspunStudio.Ports.FactSink`, so a caller can take either one. The
    port keeps the choice out of the caller.

    A Burrito binary carries no Mix, so `mix ecto.migrate` cannot run
    against it. `WeftspunStudio.Release` does the same work. The command
    line offers `weftspun db migrate`, `weftspun db seed`, and
    `weftspun db status`.
    """

    details "Local setup", ~S"""
    **Gone.** There is no cluster to start. The database is a file created on demand, so
    `mix ecto.migrate` is the whole instruction and `mix test` needs nothing before it.

    The `cockroach_local` library owns the host lifecycle. It resolves
    the binary from `COCKROACH_BIN`, then `priv/cockroach/`, then the
    path. A Mix task wraps it:

    ```
    mix weftspun.crdb install   # fetch the V-Sekai 22.1 build
    mix weftspun.crdb path      # print the binary in use
    mix weftspun.crdb           # run a node in the foreground
    ```

    `CockroachLocal.Provision` downloads the same V-Sekai release this
    RFD selects, so a second source of the binary does not arise.

    Create the schema and load the seed:

    ```
    mix ecto.setup
    WEFTSPUN_SERVE=0 mix run -e 'WeftspunStudio.Adapters.EctoFactStore.seed()'
    ```

    The node listens on 127.0.0.1:26257 and stores data under `.crdb`.
    That directory stays out of version control.

    The node runs insecure, so the `root` user needs no password. Use
    that setting on a developer machine only. A shared host needs
    certificates.
    """

    details "Settings", ~S"""
    | Variable               | Default         | Holds                                        |
    | ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | `WEFTSPUN_DB`          | `1`             | Set to `0` to start with no connection pool. |
    | `WEFTSPUN_DB_HOST`     | `127.0.0.1`     | Host name.                                   |
    | `WEFTSPUN_DB_PORT`     | `26257`         | Port.                                        |
    | `WEFTSPUN_DB_NAME`     | per environment | Database name.                               |
    | `WEFTSPUN_DB_USER`     | `root`          | User name.                                   |
    | `WEFTSPUN_DB_PASSWORD` | empty           | Password.                                    |
    | `WEFTSPUN_DB_POOL`     | `10`            | Pool size in a release.                      |

    The inventory commands need no database. `WEFTSPUN_DB=0` therefore
    lets `weftspun models list` run on a host with no cluster.
    """

    details "Risks", ~S"""
    **This risk is unchanged, and the two below are spent.**

    A second store is a second source of truth. The HTTP surface still
    reads the in memory store, so the two can drift. The next step points
    the router at `EctoFactStore` and deletes the Agent.

    CockroachDB 22.1 is old. The Oxide build tracks that version. A move
    to a later version is a separate decision.

    The suite needs a running cluster. A developer with no cluster sees
    16 failures. The test helper names the start command.
    """

    details "Status", ~S"""
    Done:

    - The V-Sekai build runs as one local node.
    - The `facts` table exists, with the category and trust indexes.
    - `EctoFactStore` implements every `FactSink` callback.
    - The seed writes 29 facts and repeats without a duplicate.
    - 16 tests cover the seed, the search, the trust moves, and the
      retraction. The whole suite passes with 78 tests.
    - `cockroach_local` provisions and runs the host, through
      `mix weftspun.crdb`. **Both are deleted.** The dependency is out of
      every `mix.exs`, and the Mix task went with it.

    ### The provisioner never reached the binary

    `mix weftspun.crdb install` answered `:unsupported_target` on every
    platform, and not only on Windows. Two faults stood in the way, and
    `cockroach_local` had neither of them.

    The task passed `:os.type()` to `Provision.install/2`. That returns an
    `{os_family, os_name}` pair such as `{:win32, :nt}` or
    `{:unix, :linux}`. The asset map is keyed `{:windows, :x86_64}`, thus
    the two shapes never matched. `target/0` derives the pair now.

    The task then passed `priv/cockroach` as the destination.
    `install/2` appends `cockroach` itself, thus the binary landed in
    `priv/cockroach/cockroach/` while `bin/1` read `priv/cockroach/`. It
    installed, and then nothing could find it. The task passes `priv` now.

    The V-Sekai release carries a Windows zip, a Linux tarball, and two
    macOS tarballs. None of them was reachable before this.

    ### Where the suite runs

    RFD 1056 moves development into a dev container. That container runs
    Linux, thus it takes the Linux tarball.

    `scripts/studio-test.sh` skips the suite when no node answers on
    127.0.0.1:26257, and it names the start command. A hook that failed
    instead would block a commit that touched no code.

    Open:

    - The router still reads the in memory store.
    - A secure cluster needs certificates and a real user.

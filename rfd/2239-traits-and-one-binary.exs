    decision ~S"""
    A trait is a mixin: a named bundle of methods with a runner that performs
    them and a census that enumerates them; the compiler's signature tables
    and block sets are the bundles. Items 1, 2 and 4 of the operator's list
    fold whole into five new traits (DressOn, Spring, Identity, Body, and the
    generated DressEdit anchor) beside the six that exist. Every tool is
    ported to Elixir first, parsing rather than matching text; every seeded
    numeric is a code from a declared codebook; the trusted-source list
    bounds data, not code; and the runtime ships as one Godot binary with
    ggml as a module. `DETAILS.md` carries the rulings and their mechanisms.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    The operator queued a plan that keeps only open items, converts three
    efforts into dataset rows for the fourth, asks for Elixir over shell and
    Python, parsing over regex, reuse over new parts, and 100,000 items per
    trait. The existing plan mixed shipped and open work, the corpus tools
    were Python with regex parsers, free floats made distinct-program counts
    unknowable, and the runtime reached its models through servers.

    details "The DSL ladder", ~S"""
    Rung 1, with this plan: `const` lines, `codebook` declarations and
    `name#c.c.c` literals, multi-output declarations, typed literal checks
    for signature arguments, a `--sigs <dir>` flag selecting a per-trait
    allowlist, `export-tables` as the one reader of the tables, `batch` for
    many jobs per process, an `ABS` block, and `# uncovered:` lines in the
    table header grammar. Rung 2, after Spring: array pins and `MUX` over an
    array, `uses <trait>` declarations checked by the netlist, `use
    <program>` composition. Rung 3, with RFD 2236's step 2: user function
    blocks. Each rung is a Lean change with an accepted and a refused fixture
    pair, the text-to-XML-to-text fixed point, and the Elixir printer
    mirrored the same day.

    A codebook is a mixed-radix index over three levels of eight, 512 codes,
    and the value is an affine image of the index over the rationals:
    `decode c = min + index(c)*(max-min)/(N-1)`. Reused from the
    recommender's Lean model: the stage index and its injectivity, bound and
    round-trip theorems. Not reused: the encoder side, whose value sum is not
    injective. A template's distinct-program space is then the product of its
    codebook sizes, and rank 3's first candidate is the neighbouring code,
    whose value differs by proof; whether the difference shows on the row's
    traces is still tried by simulation.
    """

    details "Trust, fixture inputs, inferred masks", ~S"""
    RFD 2200's verb table gains `trusts`. The tuples
    `magi-16739d--trusts--<source>` for the three trusted repositories are
    authoritative in Bao KV `relationships/`; `trust.exs` is derived from
    them and the pair is an anti-entropy check. Today the desk's certificate
    token has no read on `relationships/` (a 403 on the preflight check); the
    policy is not widened on a relay, so the tuples wait on the operator and
    the derived list serves meanwhile.

    A fixture input is a placed project a trait reads for its vocabulary or
    its skeleton and whose bytes no published row carries: the constraint
    twist sample (22 spring-bone chains) and the sandbox's translated `udon`
    set. They are not data sources and do not join the trusted list.

    An inferred mask (the matting model's alpha at a pinned revision) is
    permitted as an input to a constructed row on both arms when its
    provenance is recorded per row and the label is measured from the
    deterministic composite, never from the mask.
    """

    details "Item 4's photo leg", ~S"""
    The operator names the source: the Speaking_Faces set on the Hub
    (`issai/Speaking_Faces`, sha `eb2f8226`; paper DOI 10.3390/s21103465).
    142 subjects, nine camera positions, two trials of a silent and a
    command-reading session, a thermal stream at 464x348 and a visual
    stream at 768x512 with audio; 2.15 TB in 283 per-subject zips holding
    about 75,000 PNGs and 176 wavs per subject, already deflated; a subjects
    table with the authors' Train, Valid and Test split (100, 20, 22),
    age, gender, ethnicity and accessories. The project page releases the
    work under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0, the code under MIT, and the
    download points at the Hub with no registration form.

    The conversion is an Elixir task (`:zip` reader, Explorer writer) that
    streams one subject at a time (the desk has 1,278 GB free against 2.15
    TB) into per-subject, per-stream zstd parquet in normal form: a subjects
    relation with interned split, gender, ethnicity and accessory
    vocabularies; frames keyed by subject, trial, session, position, frame
    and stream with the PNG bytes as a binary column; utterances keyed by
    subject, trial, position, command and microphone. Three splits: the
    authors' Train is train, Valid is test, and Test is evaluation, held out
    by subject. Published as per-modality datasets under `chibifire`, private
    until the likeness and consent RFD lands, with a citation naming the
    paper, the licence page and the source sha. The leg calibrates and
    validates the head fit against real multiview photographs; no likeness
    ships, and the doctrine still rejects splicing a head onto the body. The
    population is narrow (90 Asian, 46 Caucasian, 6 Black subjects, ages 20
    to 64), which the card states, and which is why the set validates a fit
    rather than serving as an identity prior.
    """

    details "The binary", ~S"""
    One native Godot binary per platform out of `entities-godot-sandbox`,
    Vulkan everywhere, two heads. `modules/ggml` is `turboquant-godot`'s
    `modules/llm` moved under the RFD 2230 name with its ggml taken from the
    manifest at `weftspun-consolidated`, Vulkan only, the device chosen by
    name with no fallback to index 0 and none to the CPU. `modules/
    motionbricks` is stage A: the motion-bricks sources compiled against that
    module, byte-equal frames against the CMake build as the gate. Under RFD
    2229, stage A is the interim and the oracle: when RFD 2230's sandboxed
    adapter reproduces its frames, stage A stays as the parity oracle only
    and RFD 2212 is retracted. `modules/taskweft` is RFD 2205's shim over the
    standalone planner headers; `modules/game` holds the atelier scenes and
    the body host in-process; the sandbox pins advance to an upstream that
    carries SafeGDScript. The placed Godot 4.5 build stays the corpus scorer
    of record until a fixed 500-row sample per engine-bound family re-scores
    identically on the fork. The Lean compiler, the Elixir writer, mjlab,
    the ANNY line server, udon2godot and the dress-on pipeline stay outside.

    details "Every artefact lives in the parquet, in its modality's format", ~S"""
    Operator, 2026-09-08, reading a published row: "Make sure all the data is in
    parquet. I can't seem to find the source text of
    `rows/udon_scale_add/1/rank3.fbd`... this is a problem for the entire
    training datasets if we don't have that corpus data and it gets discarded.
    This is a problem for all the modalities and the i/o of the editscore data."

    The defect was real and complete. The writer kept each candidate's diagram
    under `rows/` and stored the *path* in `fbd_text`; the publisher uploads
    with `rows/` ignored and deletes any `rows/` already on the Hub. Every one
    of the eight published corpora therefore carried scores for diagrams it did
    not contain. A reader could see that rank3 compiled and missed the effect,
    and could not see the diagram that did it.

    The rule, stated once: **a row's artefacts are columns, not paths.** A
    candidate carries `fbd_text` and `fbd_xml` verbatim, `plan_json` and
    `result_json` where the family has a runner, `fbd_sha` over the text it was
    built from, and `fbd_path` only as provenance. The root row carries its
    traces as JSON strings, so the input half of an EditScore row is in the
    table with the output half. An artefact a family does not produce is an
    empty string; ETNF forbids the null.

    The formats, per modality (operator, same day): **CineForm** for image or
    audio data, because alignment across streams is the problem it exists to
    solve; **OpenUSD** for mesh data; any tensor format for latents; ZStandard
    parquet for the tabular carrier, as before.

    And the reader has to be able to look: a bare binary column shows the
    dataset viewer a byte count. A media column is a struct of `bytes` and
    `path`, and the card's `dataset_info` declares the feature; together those
    two make the viewer render a picture as a picture.
    """

    details "The green-screen keyer is not the matting model", ~S"""
    The operator asked whether a green-screen keying tool could replace the
    matting model for the dress-on garments, noting it may be used for
    dataset generation but not resold as a hosted service. It is now a
    blocklist row, and `BLOCKLIST.md` carries the argument under that row's
    subject. Two findings, and the first settles it on its own.

    **It is not a substitute.** The tool takes two inputs: a green or blue
    screen plate, and a coarse alpha hint that something else produced. It
    unmixes the screen colour out of edge pixels, which is a different task
    from isolating a subject on an arbitrary background. The garment
    photographs in the fashion set are studio and marketplace product shots,
    not screen plates, so the tool has nothing to unmix; its own repository
    ships a wrapper around the matting model as one of its optional hint
    generators, which places it downstream rather than in place.

    **The licence conflicts with publishing.** It is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 with
    additional terms: non-commercial, share-alike, no repackaging or resale,
    no paid inference service, and a separate written agreement for
    commercial software integration. The operator's reading of the resale
    term is right, but the workspace's rules bind tighter than the licence.
    The blocklist already refuses CC-BY-SA for share-alike exposure, and the
    generator row refuses a licence whose use restrictions propagate into
    anything trained on the output while exempting passthrough use. A matte
    that ships inside a CC-BY-4.0 corpus is generator use, not passthrough.
    The install path is also `uv`, which the blocklist refuses for project
    environments.

    Where it would be admissible: a passthrough pass over screen-plate
    footage whose derived mattes are never published, which the tool's own
    terms permit and the row leaves alone. No such footage is in the
    workspace. The matting model at a pinned revision stays the dress-on hint
    generator, with the model name, revision sha and input photo sha recorded
    per matte.

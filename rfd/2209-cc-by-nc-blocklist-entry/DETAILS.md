# RFD 2209 details: CC-BY-NC as a blocklist entry

## The BLOCKLIST.md section to add

Below the `CC-BY-SA` section, add:

    ### CC-BY-NC (all versions)

    A non-commercial restriction on a row propagates into any
    corpus, dataset, or artifact that ships the row. The
    workspace's deployments (VRChat, service demos, HF datasets,
    trained models) are commercial in the sense the licence
    excludes, sales, ad-supported distribution, and paid access
    are all on the table for shipped work, and a licence that
    reserves them defeats the downstream question before it is
    asked.

    Same shape as CC-BY-SA's row. Different clause (non-commercial
    vs. share-alike); the downstream cost of ignoring it is the
    same.

    **Concrete case (2026-09-05):** dataforged
    (`github.com/rsek/dataforged`) carries a mixed licence.
    `dist/starforged/*.json` is CC-BY-4.0 and ships as
    `chibifire/starforged` on HuggingFace. The `ironsworn/`
    subtree and raster illustrations are CC-BY-NC-4.0 and are
    filtered out by `scripts/build_starforged_hf.py` before the
    parquet write. `scripts/check_starforged_hf.py` asserts every
    surviving row is CC-BY-4.0 as a rule-3 named-not-silent gate.

    **What is not banned.** Reading CC-BY-NC content for
    inspection, citing it in an RFD, or naming it as a source is
    fine. Shipping its content in a derived corpus is the case
    this row covers.

## Filter implementation shape

Every builder that ingests a mixed-licence source carries the
same three-step shape:

1. Read the source row.
2. Consult the row's licence field (dataforged tags each entry;
   other sources may need per-source lookup logic).
3. If `licence in {"CC-BY-NC-4.0", "CC-BY-NC-3.0",
   "CC-BY-NC-SA-*", "CC-BY-NC-ND-*"}`, drop the row and
   increment a counter.

At the end of the build, print the drop count and a per-licence
histogram of dropped rows. A silent skip reads as a pass; rule 3
says name the count. The reference implementation is in
`scripts/build_starforged_hf.py` from the current session.

## Verification

- **Positive:** `check_starforged_hf.py` reads the shipped
  parquet shards and asserts `every row's licence == CC-BY-4.0`.
- **Negative control** (rule 2): the checker's `--self-test`
  mutates one row's licence field to `CC-BY-NC-4.0` in memory
  and asserts the checker fails on that row.
- **Builder self-test:** `build_starforged_hf.py --self-test`
  runs against a small hand-built fixture with a planted
  CC-BY-NC row and asserts the row is dropped, the drop count is
  1, and the output does not contain the row's id.

## Related retractions

None. The blocklist row is additive; no earlier decision is
withdrawn. The corresponding CC-BY-SA row on the blocklist is not
touched.

This RFD was drafted by an AI and read by a human before it shipped.

## Decision

Add a row to CLAUDE.md's "Blocklists" table:

    | **CC-BY-NC (all versions)** | non-commercial restriction propagates into anything derived from the row, same downstream-risk shape as CC-BY-SA, see below |

with a corresponding section in `BLOCKLIST.md` argued below. The
row is enforced two places:

1. **Build-script filter.** Any script that ingests a mixed-licence
   source reads each row's licence field and drops CC-BY-NC rows
   before the parquet or SQLite write. Reports the drop count as a
   rule-3 named-not-silent gate.
2. **CI on manuals-weftspun.** `scripts/check_starforged_hf.py`
   asserts `every row's licence == CC-BY-4.0` (or another
   commercial-clean licence the workspace already accepts). A
   CC-BY-NC row surviving the filter fails CI.

The rule does NOT ban *reading* CC-BY-NC content locally for
inspection. It bans CC-BY-NC rows from shipping in a derived
corpus, a training dataset, a demo fixture, or any artifact this
workspace publishes.

## Problem

Concrete case that produced this RFD: **dataforged**, the
community JSON rendering of the Starforged and Ironsworn SRDs at
`github.com/rsek/dataforged`, carries a mixed licence:

- `dist/starforged/*.json`, CC-BY-4.0. Ships.
- `ironsworn/` subtree, CC-BY-NC-4.0. Filtered out.
- Raster illustrations, CC-BY-NC-4.0. Filtered out.

Without the filter, `chibifire/starforged` on HuggingFace would
have shipped CC-BY-NC rows mixed with CC-BY-4.0 rows under a
single licence declaration. That is a licence-provenance failure
for downstream consumers who take the workspace at its word that
`chibifire/starforged` is CC-BY-4.0. The filter closes it. The
row on CLAUDE.md's blocklist ensures the *next* mixed-licence
source (dataforged is not going to be the last) inherits the same
handling by default rather than by anyone remembering.

The failure mode is the same as CC-BY-SA's, a share-alike or
non-commercial restriction that propagates into anything derived
from the row. Different clause, same downstream shape. The CC-BY-SA
row already on the blocklist is the argument this row mirrors.

## Non-goals

Not a rule against every restrictive licence, CC0, MIT, Apache,
CC-BY-4.0, and the other permissive licences the workspace
already accepts continue to. Not a rule against downloading
CC-BY-NC content for personal inspection (an operator reading the
Ironsworn PDF is fine; a corpus builder ingesting its text is not).
Not a rule against forking or citing CC-BY-NC works, attribution
of a source is different from shipping its content.

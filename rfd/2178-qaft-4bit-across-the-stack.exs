    decision ~S"""
    Every model in the atelier-workshop (the pipeline) targets QAFT 4-bit; three classes (A upstream available, B feasible locally, C infeasible locally) track where each stands.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    RFD 1027 (QAFT-first weights) committed QAFT-first as the default weights format. RFD 2139 (QAFT stack survey, abandoned) found only Gemma-4-12B ships a true upstream QAT Q4_0 release. Wan-VACE, Pixal3D, VoxHammer, MoGe-3, and the audio-panel models run at published precision. The plan needs a per-model position: which model is QAFT'd, when, at what compute cost.
    """

    section "The three classes", ~S"""
    - Class A (upstream QAFT available): use verbatim. Gemma-4-12B QAT Q4_0 today.
    - Class B (upstream QAFT feasible locally): the workspace produces one from published weights via a QAFT fine-tune on the RTX 3090. Small models (Qwen3-TTS-1.7B, Kimodo, SkinTokens, MoGe-3, rf-detr-Seg, WavLM, wav2vec2, ipa-whisper) fit in one overnight run each.
    - Class C (upstream QAFT infeasible locally): Wan-VACE 14B, Pixal3D 24 GB base. QAFT needs multi-day runs; parked until compute expands or an upstream Q4 release lands.
    
    See [DETAILS.md](DETAILS.md) for the per-model class, size, and compute estimate. See RFD 1027 (QAFT-first weights) for the QAFT-first rule.

    details "Sequencing", ~S"""
    Class-B QAFT rungs, cheapest first, so each result unblocks the next:
    
    1. **Voice-adjacent small models first**, Qwen3-TTS-1.7B, wav2vec2,
       Parakeet, ipa-whisper. Overnight batch. Unblocks RFD 2167
       (voice-reward distillation) because both the reward LoRA base and
       the TTS candidate generation stop dominating inference cost.
    2. **Segmentation + inpainting**, rf-detr-Seg, LaMa. Hours. Small
       in the compute budget; large in the RFD 1168 layer-decomposition
       path's per-view cost.
    3. **Motion + rigging**, Kimodo, SkinTokens, MoGe-3. Hours each.
    4. **Mid-tier vision + audio**, TRELLIS.2 (~8B), Voxtral (3B),
       Whisper large-v3. Overnight runs.
    5. **Class C (Wan-VACE, Pixal3D)**, parked. Either an upstream Q4
       lands or the workspace acquires >24 GB training capacity.
    """

    details "Compute cost of the plan", ~S"""
    Rough total for Class B (all rungs 1-4): about a week of continuous
    3090 wall-time if run serially. Roughly a weekend if parallelised
    across a Mac (MPS QLoRA for the smallest) and the 3090 (true QAFT
    for the mid-tier). CLAUDE.md's Compute constraint applies: rented
    compute stays blocklisted; runs happen on the desktop machine.
    """

    details "Retraction / adjustment note", ~S"""
    RFD 2139 read "no true-QAFT 4-bit checkpoints exist upstream" as
    "only Gemma runs QAFT-quantized." That reading conflated "upstream
    publishes one" with "the workspace can have one." This RFD splits
    those two into Class A vs Class B. Wan-VACE and Pixal3D stay in
    Class C, matching RFD 2139's concern for those specific models.

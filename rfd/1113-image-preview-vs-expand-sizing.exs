  rfd 1113, "Image preview stays 250px, the expand modal stays separate" do
    state :committed

    scope "`src/components/expandedImagePreview.css`,\n`ImagePanelPreview.{css,jsx}`, `TextureExtractor.css`"

    attest_in :none

    decision ~S"""
    Two variables, two jobs, never merged. `--panel-image-preview-height`
    holds the in-panel size, at `250px`. Krea's task-row thumbnail and
    the Texture Extractor's `.texture-preview` grid tile both use it.
    `--expand-modal-image-preview-max-height` holds the click-to-expand
    size, at `min(80vh, 512px)`. The expand modal and the Texture
    Extractor's `.texture-details-preview img` both use it. Both
    variables live in `expandedImagePreview.css` only; no other file
    redefines either one.
    
    The in-panel preview does not grow on hover. It expands only on a
    click, into the modal. A change to one context's size, without an
    explicit user request naming both, must not touch the other
    context's variable.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    An in-panel image preview (a Krea task-row thumbnail, or a Texture
    Extractor grid tile) and its click-to-expand modal share one visual
    job, showing the same image larger. A single CSS variable once
    served both, so a fix to one size regressed the other. The user
    confirmed the current split on 2026-06-30, per
    `rules/image-preview-sizing-protected.mdc`.
    """

    related ~S"""
    RFD 1000 gives the DRY policy this split rule follows: one token,
    one owner, one file. RFD 1112 lists this rule among `rules/`'s guard
    rules, and points here for the design it protects.

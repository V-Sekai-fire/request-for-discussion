    Feed the Taskweft engine a **fleet domain**, a single JSON-LD
    document conforming to
    `3-interactor/taskweft/priv/schemas/rectgtn_domain.schema.json`, that
    names the live peers as entities, their owned resources as capability
    edges, the verbs peers execute as actions, and known decompositions as
    methods. Every peer answers "what should I do next?" with the same

    """

    details_title "RECTGTN fleet coordination"

    details "Fleet-domain shape", ~S"""
    Checked in at `2-contract/manuals-weftspun/rectgtn/fleet.jsonld`,
    conforming to
    `3-interactor/taskweft/priv/schemas/rectgtn_domain.schema.json`. The
    document is one full RECTGTN domain (`actions`, `methods`,
    `capabilities`, `variables`, `todo_list`, same shape as
    `priv/plans/problems/work_queue.jsonld` in the Taskweft repo).
    
    ### Entities
    
    One per live peer CN, `hero.<mps-suffix>.agents.weftspun`,
    `anchor.<mps-suffix>.agents.weftspun`, and so on. The CN is the full
    form under `agents/<cn>.agents.weftspun` per RFD 2195. Session-local
    aliases (HERO / ANCHOR / SIDEKICK / HERD) are not entities in the
    domain, the CN is the address.
    
    ### Capability edges
    
    Populated by `sync_fleet_domain.py`, which reads `agents/*` Bao rows
    and writes edges of these shapes under `capabilities.graph.edges`:
    
        {"subject":"hero.<cn>","rel":"runs-on","object":"windows-desktop"}
        {"subject":"hero.<cn>","rel":"owns","object":"gpu-3090"}
        {"subject":"hero.<cn>","rel":"may-use--gpu","object":"gpu-3090"}
        {"subject":"hero.<cn>","rel":"may-use--hf-repo","object":"chibifire/*"}
        {"subject":"hero.<cn>","rel":"may-use--uplink","object":"windows-desktop"}
    
    Contention is expressed by `may-use--gpu`, a peer without an edge
    cannot bind an action that guards on it. Un-park is a caveat on the
    edge, not a message.
    
    ### Actions
    
    Fleet verbs peers actually execute, each with an ISO-8601 `duration`
    and a `rebac/check` guard:
    
        open-pr, run-ci, extract-safetensors, train-qat,
        render-shard, publish-hf-dataset, merge-pr
    
    Example (in Elixir DSL form; the JSON-LD form is the compiled output):
    
        train_qat: %{
          params: [:actor, :model_id, :precision],
          check: [
            %{eval: %{type: "rebac/check",
                      subject: "{actor}", rel: "may-use--gpu", object: "{model_id}_gpu"}}
          ],
          body: [
            %{pointer_set: "/agents/{actor}/claims/gpu", value: "{model_id}_gpu"},
            %{pointer_set: "/goal/{model_id}/status", value: "qat_running"}
          ],
          duration: "PT4H"
        }
    
    ### Methods
    
    Known decompositions. First landing methods:
    
        ship-a-Q4-quant:
          alternatives:
           , name: extract_then_train
              subtasks:
               , [extract-safetensors, {actor}, {model_id}]
               , [train-qat, {actor}, {model_id}, "int4"]
               , [validate, {actor}, {model_id}]
               , [publish-hf-dataset, {actor}, {model_id}]
           , name: use_aero_ex_configs
              subtasks:
               , [update-config-pins, {actor}, {model_id}]
               , [extract-safetensors, {actor}, {model_id}]
               , [train-qat, {actor}, {model_id}, "int4"]
               , [validate, {actor}, {model_id}]
               , [publish-hf-dataset, {actor}, {model_id}]
    
        land-a-clean-pr:
          alternatives:
           , name: open_then_merge
              subtasks:
               , [open-pr, {actor}, {repo}, {branch}]
               , [run-ci, {actor}, {repo}, {branch}]
               , [merge-pr, {actor}, {repo}, {branch}]
    
    Alternatives are ordered: the planner tries the first, falls to the
    second when a `TwMethodSkip` write on the fleet's skip rows says the
    first is blocked. That is the same `nearest_retryable_ancestor`
    backjump `tw_soltree.hpp` already implements.
    
    ### Variables
    
    State pointers the actions read and write:
    
        /agents/<cn>/claims/<resource> -> <resource_id> | null
        /goal/<id>/status              -> pending | extracted | qat_running |
                                           validated | published | failed
        /skip/<task_key>#<method_idx>  -> true | absent
    
    `<task_key>` is the C++ planner's `tw_call_key`, action-or-method name
    plus stringified args, so a skip row keys on the specific instance,
    not the verb.
    
    ### Todo list
    
    Today's operator-set goals as `TwGoal` bindings. Example:
    
        "todo_list": [
          {"goal": [{"pointer": "/goal/motionbricks/status", "eq": "published"}]}
        ]
    
    Standing `TwMultiGoal` entries cover steady-state work (open PRs must
    reach `merged` before quarter close, and so on).
    """

    details "Coordinator adapter", ~S"""
    New module `3-interactor/taskweft/lib/taskweft/coordinator.ex`, ~150
    lines. Public API:
    
    - `snapshot/0`, read `agents/*` Bao rows and the RFD board's current
      goal statuses, materialise `fleet.jsonld` in memory.
    - `pick/1`, `Taskweft.plan(snapshot, actor: cn)`, return the first
      `TwCall` whose bindings resolve `actor` to `cn`. Returns `nil` when
      no task in the plan is assignable to that peer.
    - `publish/2`, write the returned Task as an ordinary row at
      `agents/<cn>/assignment` with a `SqlarCas.Caveat` carrying
      `{"type":"expires_at","at": start + duration}`.
    - `fail/2`, write a truthy row at `/skip/<task_key>#<method_idx>` so
      the next `Taskweft.replan` treats it as `TwMethodSkip` and
      backjumps.
    
    Reuses `Taskweft.JSONLD.Loader.validate/2` and `Taskweft.MCP.Server`
    without modification. The caveat primitive is imported verbatim from
    `7-service/service-sqlar-cas/lib/sqlar_cas/caveat.ex`, no fork.
    """

    details "Tiebreak order", ~S"""
    Encoded in the domain's `methods.alternatives` list order, the
    planner picks the first alternative that satisfies its guards and
    has no matching `/skip/` row. Operator priority (e.g. `land-clean-pr`
    before `render-shard`) is a domain edit, not a coordinator argument.
    The domain is checked into git; the tiebreak is diffable.
    """

    details "Pilot before rollout", ~S"""
    One end-to-end trace on the seeded fleet before flipping the
    ceremony:
    
    1. Encode "ship MotionBricks Q4" as a `TwGoal` with HERO's
       `may-use--gpu` edge present.
    2. `Coordinator.pick(hero_cn)`, assert `extract-safetensors`, not
       `train-qat`. The extractor is the unmet predecessor.
    3. Manually mark extraction done; re-`pick`, assert `train-qat`.
    4. Encode HERO's real config-hash blocker as a
       `/skip/train-qat#0` write; assert the backjump picks the
       `use_aero_ex_configs` alternative rather than looping on the
       original method.
    
    If any step fails, the fleet domain is wrong and the RFD moves back to
    `discussion`. If all pass, the RFD moves to `published` and the
    ceremony's step 3 flips in one commit.
    """

    details "Compute-lease broker", ~S"""
    RFD 2202 named "compute-lease broker" as future work. This RFD is
    that broker in miniature: a peer's `may-use--gpu` edge is a lease,
    and the assignment row's `expires_at` caveat is its TTL. When the
    caveat expires, `Coordinator.pick` no longer sees the row and the
    next `plan` reassigns the GPU. No new Sentinel, no new engine, the
    caveat primitive plus the planner's own capability check are enough.
    """

    details "Migration", ~S"""
    - **RFD 2201 step 3**: swap the free-form message for
      `Coordinator.snapshot |> pick |> publish`. The `SendMessage` still
      fires (operator-visible), but its body is generated from the
      assignment row rather than composed by hand.
    - **Un-park signals**: an un-park is a write to `agents/<cn>/claims/*`
      clearing a stale claim, plus (optionally) a `TwGoal` added to the
      todo_list. The operator's terminal-typed direct signal remains the
      ground-truth authoriser.
    - **Persona reflex**: `SqlarCas.Persona.reflex/2`'s docstring
      promises "multi-step decomposition is a follow-up in `Taskweft.SQL`."
      This RFD replaces that promise: the persona uses `Taskweft.plan`
      over a per-persona sub-domain, and `Taskweft.SQL` is not built.
    """

    details "Verification", ~S"""
    - **Determinism**: two peers, same snapshot revision → disjoint tasks
      whose union is a prefix of `Taskweft.plan(snapshot)`. Test:
      `3-interactor/taskweft/test/coordinator_determinism_test.exs`.
    - **Capability reactivity**: one-line edge change moves the winning
      task to another peer on the next `pick`. Test asserts the diff.
    - **TTL correctness**: an assignment past `expires_at` is not
      returned; the oracle is `SqlarCas.Caveat.satisfied?/2` (already
      unit-tested).
    - **Backjumping**: a skip-row write produces an alternative method,
      not the same method again. Reuses the sol-tree tests already in
      Taskweft's suite; adds one integration test at the fleet layer.
    - **Negative control**: a planted broken domain (missing capability
      edge) → `pick` returns `nil` for every peer, and the coordinator
      surfaces "no assignable Task" rather than silently returning the
      first `TwCall`. Rule 2 of CLAUDE.md's verification list.
    - **Browser reviewability**: the WASM SQLite demo in
      `7-service/service-sqlar-cas/docs/` gets the fleet-domain tables
      in its fixture and renders the plan sol-tree client-side, so a
      reader can inspect the planner's output without an Elixir toolchain.
    """

    details "From the README, moved here on 2026-09-07", ~S"""
    **Coordinator adapter as an Elixir module:** retracted 2026-09-05,
    see [RFD 2205](../2205-taskweft-in-bao/README.md), superseded by
    an in-Bao database-plugin (Go binary, cgo-linked C++ planner) that
    callers reach via `bao read taskweft/creds/<goal_id>`. This RFD's
    "fleet-domain document" scope stays live; the "adapter" scope
    moves to 2205.
    """

    details "Decision", ~S"""
    Feed the Taskweft engine a **fleet domain**, a single JSON-LD
    document conforming to
    `3-interactor/taskweft/priv/schemas/rectgtn_domain.schema.json`, that
    names the live peers as entities, their owned resources as capability
    edges, the verbs peers execute as actions, and known decompositions as
    methods. Every peer answers "what should I do next?" with the same
    call: `Taskweft.plan(fleet, actor: self_cn)`. Contention becomes
    capability tuples; ordering becomes ISO-8601 durations; peer authority
    becomes the ReBAC relations Taskweft already speaks
    (`HAS_CAPABILITY`, `OWNS`, `IS_MEMBER_OF`, `DELEGATED_TO`,
    `SUPERVISOR_OF`, `PARTNER_OF`, `CAN_ENTER`, `CAN_INSTANCE`). No new
    planner, no new SQL layer, no port of RECTGTN into Bao; the engine is
    the ground-truth solver and the fleet is a domain that feeds it.
    
    The seven-step coordinate-agents ceremony (RFD 2201) stays. One line
    of step 3 ("notify peers") becomes `Coordinator.snapshot |>
    Coordinator.pick(self) |> Coordinator.publish(self)`. Determinism
    against the shared snapshot removes the need to relay next-item picks
    in prose. Assignment rows carry a `SqlarCas.Caveat` with
    `{"type":"expires_at","at":start+duration}`, the compute-lease broker
    RFD 2202 named as future work, filled by reusing the caveat primitive
    that already exists in service-sqlar-cas.
    """

    details "Problem", ~S"""
    Peer sessions coordinate through three ad-hoc channels: Bao rows, free-
    form `SendMessage` prose, and operator-typed un-park signals. There
    is no shared representation of *why* a peer is doing what it is doing,
    so a peer that reranks does it by hand, a peer that finishes an item
    picks the next one from a board it interprets alone, and the operator
    carries the priority ordering in their head each turn. The
    `may-use--<device>` tuples RFD 2202 introduced are documentation only —
    nothing gates work on them. When two peers want the same GPU or the
    same HF repo, prose adjudicates.
    """

    details "Non-goals", ~S"""
    Not a scheduler; not a hook; not a replacement for the operator's
    right to reprioritise mid-turn. The fleet domain is a snapshot the
    operator edits like any other document, the planner is deterministic
    against whatever the snapshot says. Not a claim that RECTGTN scales to
    100+ peers today; the pilot is single-Goal, single-decomposition, and
    the engine's search bounds already surface a "no assignable Task"
    answer rather than looping.
    """

    details "Related", ~S"""
    - RFD 2200 (ReBAC agent roles), supplies the relation vocabulary the
      fleet domain reuses.
    - RFD 2201 (coordinate-agents ceremony), step 3 gets the one-line
      hook; the other six steps are unchanged.
    - RFD 2202 (ReBAC Bao enforcement), this RFD fills the compute-lease
      broker gap RFD 2202 named as future work.

      from and writes back to.

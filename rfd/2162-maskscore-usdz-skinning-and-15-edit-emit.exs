    feature "proper 104-joint skin bindings inside the Video-stub USDZ,\nplus emit coverage of the 5 pose edits added alongside the 10 face\nedits under RFD 1173."

    scope "`6-datasource/anny-render-corpus`"

    preamble ~S"""
    Shelved 2026-09-02: 2162.1 (104-joint ANNY skeleton in USDZ) shipped in
    weftspun/anny-render-corpus#34. 2162.2 (mesh 15-edit expansion) needs
    render capacity currently unbudgeted; resume when local GPU frees.
    """

    decision ~S"""
    Extend `compute_blendshape_targets.py` to also emit the joint bind
    and rest transforms plus vertex-bone weights ANNY exposes at
    `vertex_bone_indices` and `vertex_bone_weights`. `emit_video_usdz.py`
    writes them under the mesh's `SkelBindingAPI` and populates
    `SkelAnimation.jointTransforms` from each candidate's `pose_soma`.

    Also update `maskscore_rung_1_stubs.py` to include the 5 pose edits in
    the 5-stub (mesh/depth/pose/keypoints/multimodal) emit so all 15 edits
    appear in the ETNF parquets.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    The Video-stub USDZ shipped in the Rung 1.5 first pass writes a dummy
    1-joint skeleton. The 10 face edits animate correctly because their
    work happens in `SkelAnimation.blendShapeWeights`. The 5 pose edits
    (head_tilt, head_nod, head_turn, jaw_open_bone, shoulders_up) added
    next need `SkelAnimation.jointTransforms` time samples over the real
    104-joint hierarchy (ANNY total; SOMA canonical pose is 78 pose params at anny call time = 77 Kimodo rotvecs + anny-prepended root, task #76),
    and skin weights per vertex, or the animation plays back as a rest pose.

    scope "the apparatus in this directory"

    decision ~S"""
    None recorded. The serial was allocated and the apparatus (`Dockerfile`, `probe.c`, `probe.sh`) was written; the document was not. The serial stays allocated, as RFD 1000 says a serial never moves once issued.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    A directory with code and no README reads as a document that was deleted rather than one that was never written. This page names which it is.

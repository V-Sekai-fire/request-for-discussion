    decision ~S"""
    Drop the `allosaurus-rus` phone-inventory control; the panel drops from 8 tracks to 7, keeping `universal` as the language-inventory-free default and `eng` as the English control.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    RFD 2164 (Rung 1 corpus) shipped allosaurus at three inventories: `universal`, `eng`, `rus`. The `rus` inventory was picked as a plausible L1 transfer partner for the first SpeakingFaces subject (Kazakh L2 English speaker); RFD 2170 (allosaurus language set) then generalised the set. The panel's implementation still carries `rus` as a per-clip inventory and runs it on every clip regardless of the speaker's L1.
    """

    section "Panel after the drop", ~S"""
      text-track   Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3, Voxtral Mini 3B, wav2vec2
      IPA-track    Voxtral-IPA, Gemma-4-12B GBNF-IPA
      phone-track  allosaurus universal + eng
    
    Per-clip language inventories can be added back keyed to the speaker's L1 if a future corpus documents it, rather than one hard-coded language for everyone.
    
    Follow-ups: `emit_10track_panel.py` and `add_allosaurus_control.py` drop the `rus` inventory; downstream RFDs lose their `rus` mentions; `CITATION.cff` unaffected (allosaurus itself stays).
    """

    Extends RFD 2179 (Whisper drop) and RFD 2180 (gemma-auto drop). Amends the panel row in RFD 2170 (allosaurus language set)'s decision that named `universal + eng + rus`.

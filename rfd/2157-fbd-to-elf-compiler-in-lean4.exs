    decision ~S"""
    New repo `taskweft-fbd-compiler`, Lean 4 v4.34.0-rc1 (matches RFD
    2144), MIT. Pipeline:

        PLCopen FBD XML
          -> Lean 4 parser (Std.Xml, stdlib only)
          -> FBD AST (full IEC 61131-3 standard block library)
          -> RISC-V instruction encoder + ELF64 writer, both in Lean
          -> plan.elf bytes to disk, no external assembler or linker
          -> godot-sandbox loads

    **ABI:** matches `gdscript.elf`'s syscall table.
    **GDScript I/O:** `get_variable`/`set_variable` for state,
    `sandbox.call('fn', args)` for actions.

    RFD 2156 is the parallel GDScript-side path. `DETAILS.md` carries
    AST, ABI, staging.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    RFDs 2154-2151 reach godot-sandbox through GDScript. There's no
    compiler for the direct path: FBD in, ELF out. A verified compiler
    in Lean 4 would carry proofs the ELF's state graph matches the
    FBD's own, not just tests.

    details "The three MIT pieces the compiler stitches together", ~S"""
    1. **PLCopen FBD XML** produced by `Taskweft.OpenPLC.PLCopen.emit/1`
      (RFD 2150). Full body inside a `<pou pouType="program">`, no `<SFC>`
      wrapper (blocklisted), no `<ST>` / `<LD>` (blocklisted).
    2. **Lean 4 v4.34.0-rc1** (matches RFD 2149), stdlib only for stage 1.
      `Std.Xml` supplies the XML parser; no mathlib fetch until the
      correctness theorem lands under its own RFD.
    3. **`riscv64-elf-gcc`** already installed on this box (`brew install
      riscv64-elf-gcc`, RFD 2154 bootstrap). The Lean compiler emits
      `.s`, the toolchain runs `as` + `ld` to produce the `.elf`.
    """

    details "FBD AST; full IEC 61131-3 standard block library", ~S"""
    Stage 1 lists every standard block in the AST but implements the
    emit for only the subset our own emitter produces today (SR_L, AND,
    MOVE, TON). Later stages fill in the rest as consumers name them.

        inductive Block where
          | sr_l  | rs   | sr        ; bistables
          | and_ | or_  | not_ | xor ; boolean
          | move | mux  | sel  | limit | min | max  ; selection
          | ton  | tof  | tp        ; timers
          | ctu  | ctd  | ctud      ; counters
          | add  | sub  | mul  | div | mod  ; arithmetic
          | eq   | ne   | lt   | gt  | le | ge  ; comparison
          | f_trig | r_trig                    ; edges

    Each carries its typed inputs and outputs. `POU` wraps a variable
    list and a network of `Block` instances connected by `Wire`s.
    """

    details "godot-sandbox syscall ABI to target", ~S"""
    The ELF exports one entry (`on_tick`) and calls back into the host
    via a small syscall table libriscv/godot-sandbox already defines for
    its `gdscript.elf` sample. The exact numbers come from godot-sandbox's
    `syscalls.hpp`; pinning that header's version is a follow-on so ABI
    drift is caught. Stage-1 uses:

        ecall #1  print(cstr)
        ecall #10 get_variable(cstr_name) -> Variant
        ecall #11 set_variable(cstr_name, Variant)
        ecall #20 register_callable(cstr_name, fn_ptr)
        ecall #21 call_callable(cstr_name, args...)

    The RECTGTN `done_*` booleans become variables the host reads with
    `get_variable`; RECTGTN actions register as callables the host
    invokes with `call_callable`.
    """

    details "Stages", ~S"""
    | stage | scope |
    |---|---|
    | 1 (this RFD) | Skeleton: lakefile, AST types, `Std.Xml` parser, RISC-V IR + emitter stubs, `Main.lean` smoke on `weftspun-build.plcopen.xml` |
    | 2 | RISC-V emitter body for SR_L / AND / MOVE / TON; round-trip test compiles and runs in godot-sandbox |
    | 3 | Semantics module + `compile_correct` theorem (brings mathlib in) |
    | 4 | Emit for the remaining standard blocks per the AST above |
    | 5 | GDScript companion module (`get_variable` / `set_variable` / `call` wrappers on the Godot side), `mix openplc.compile --target elf-lean` |
    """

    details "RECTGTN -> FBD mapping; deferred", ~S"""
    RECTGTN's own shape (domain, problem, plan) still needs a mapping
    into POUs. Stage 1 accepts hand-authored PLCopen FBD; the mapping
    lands under its own RFD once the compiler works. Candidate shape,
    recorded here so it doesn't get lost: domain = Function Block library
    (one FB per RECTGTN action), problem = Program POU wiring initial
    state, plan = Program POU wiring action-FB calls in the planned
    order.
    """

    details "Verification", ~S"""
    1. `lake build` in `3-interactor/taskweft-fbd-compiler/` succeeds in
      seconds; no external deps.
    2. `./.lake/build/bin/taskweft_fbd_compiler` runs on
      `weftspun-build.plcopen.xml` produced by `mix openplc.emit` and
      prints the AST's variable and step counts.
    3. Workspace anti-entropy passes; no blocklist rows added; serial
      S2157 registered.
    """

    details "What is deliberately not here", ~S"""
    1. mathlib fetch + build (stage 3).
    2. RECTGTN -> FBD mapping decision (its own RFD).
    3. The RISC-V emitter body (stage 2).
    4. Semantics + correctness theorem (stage 3).
    5. GDScript companion module (stage 5).
    6. Runtime performance profiling; real fbd -> elf -> sandbox tick
      timing lands with stage 2.

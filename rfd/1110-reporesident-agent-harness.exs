    decision ~S"""
    Weftspun3DStudio adopted RepoResident on 2026-07-23, replacing an
    earlier "MindLink" personal-memory approach, now archived to
    `.agent/areas/mindlink.md`. Context loads in five capped layers:
    `CLAUDE.md` (operating rules, every session), `STATE.md` (current
    state, rewritten in full each session, every session), one workflow
    file matched to the task, then project facts and decisions, then
    targeted source. Five roles (Architect, Builder, Fixer, Reviewer,
    Curator) carry different rules for the same repository, not
    conversational personas. `STATE.md` stays a live handoff, not a
    decision record; it holds no lasting content and does not become
    part of this RFD.
    
    See `DETAILS.md` for the file map, the context-layer table, the
    workflow-selection rules, and the technical decisions from
    `DECISIONS.md` not already covered by another RFD.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    A coding agent session that loads every project file, every closed
    issue, and every past design spends context on history instead of
    the current task. Without a named procedure per task type, agents
    improvise process, and a large model and a small model handle
    ambiguity differently. Without a place for state to persist,
    knowledge learned in one session does not reach the next.
    """

    related ~S"""
    RFD 1086 gives the Surface/DGX topology `PROJECT.md`'s sync-ownership
    rule depends on. RFD 1099 gives the operator command cheat sheet this
    harness's workflows point to for exact commands.

    Rules for a phase, not conversational personas.
    
    - **Architect:** scopes and designs without writing implementation code.
    - **Builder:** implements an approved design without changing its structure silently.
    - **Fixer:** makes the smallest complete correction and avoids unrelated refactoring.
    - **Reviewer:** reports verified findings and does not rewrite unless asked.
    - **Curator:** maintains the harness and its bounded knowledge files.

    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `bootstrap.md` | First session on a new or adopted project; `CLAUDE.md` still has `<fill>` placeholders, or `STATE.md` Session is 0 |
    | `patch.md`     | Small fix, cause known or trivially findable, no interface change, at most two files                               |
    | `debug.md`     | A defect whose cause is unknown; output is a named root cause with evidence, then `patch.md` or `feature.md`       |
    | `feature.md`   | New capability, or any change touching more than two files or any interface/schema/dependency                      |
    | `refactor.md`  | Structure improvement with zero behavior change; a bug found mid-refactor gets parked, not bundled                 |
    | `review.md`    | Reviewing a diff, PR, or branch; best run fresh, from a session that did not write the code                        |
    | `maintain.md`  | Every tenth session, or when a size budget is blown, or the user asks; checks the harness against the repository   |
    
    `feature.md`'s exit test: if a change has a single known site, no
    interface change, and obvious verification, it downgrades to
    `patch.md`. `patch.md` escalates to `feature.md` the moment an
    interface or schema must change, or the fix wants more than two
    files; it escalates to `debug.md` the moment five files are read and
    the cause still cannot be named with evidence.
    """

    details "Technical decisions not covered by another RFD", ~S"""
    From `.agent/DECISIONS.md`, append-only, project-specific choices
    this repository's own numbered RFDs do not yet record:
    
    - **2026-07-26, XR disembody:** the avatar exits at the exit spot
      facing the headset, the viewer stands one meter behind, and
      Move-to-Viewpoint, X, and the stick-click all work without opening
      a menu. Embody never shifts the rig's Y position. Reason:
      user-confirmed on the Galaxy XR editing flow.
    - **2026-07-26, LingBot Gaussian-splat worlds:** these use Spark with
      `orientationMode: none`, never an XYZRGB point stride, since the
      wrong stride scatters points. Gravity-aligned point clouds must not
      receive TripoSplat's X-flip.
    - **2026-06-26, API↔client contracts:** must land together, since
      `models.yaml` and `aiModelsCatalog.js`/`taskManager.js` describe
      the same models from two sides.
    
    Decisions already carried by other RFDs, not repeated here: UI on
    the Surface, API on the DGX (RFD 1086); scp-based sync with no agent
    git push (RFD 1086, RFD 1099); RepoResident's own adoption,
    replacing MindLink (this RFD's README).

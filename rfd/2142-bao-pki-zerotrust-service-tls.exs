    details "Why a standalone root CA rather than an intermediate", ~S"""
    The FDB root CA key (`fdb-ca.chibifire.com`, SHA-256 fingerprint
    `89:20:69:EB:BF:AB:...`) was lost twice. The first loss is
    documented in RFD 2141. The second happened during this session:
    `op item create` returned item IDs that do not correspond to any
    persisted item. The `op item edit` path (updating an existing item)
    did persist. The failure mode is a biometric timeout that `op`
    reports as exit code 0 with an item ID in stdout.

    Chaining under the FDB CA would require the FDB CA key or another
    full cluster TLS rotation. Bao's PKI engine generates and stores
    its own root key internally, so no external CA key is needed.

    The two trust domains are separate by design: the FDB CA gates
    cluster membership (verify-peers rule
    `S.CN>=fdb-,S.CN<=.chibifire.com`), and bao's PKI gates service
    authentication to the secrets API.

    Note: the `ttl=87600h` (10 years) and `max_ttl=8760h` (1 year) below
    were retracted by RFD 2145 on 2026-09-01. Current guidance:
    `ttl=26280h` (3 years) on intermediates, `max_ttl=2160h` (90 days) on
    service leaves. The old values are kept where they stand so a reader
    following an older link sees the change; new deploys use RFD 2145's
    numbers.

    The certificate, private key, and CA chain are returned in the

    `BAO_TLS_CERT_B64` and `BAO_TLS_KEY_B64`. Store the CA cert as

    The entrypoint decodes `BAO_TLS_CERT_B64`, `BAO_TLS_KEY_B64`, and

    existing FDB client TLS material.

    A service presenting a client cert with

    1. Issue a client cert:

    2. Store cert/key as Fly secrets on spot-broker.

    3. The entrypoint authenticates to bao via TLS cert auth, receives
       a scoped token, reads `secret/data/vastai/api`, and exports
       `VAST_API_KEY`. The Elixir code is unchanged.

    4. Elixir services that need dynamic secret access (lease renewal,
       cert rotation) use `libvault` (hex.pm, 14k recent downloads).
       For a static bearer token like the Vast.ai key, an entrypoint
       curl is sufficient.
    """

    details "The gate", ~S"""
    The gate asserts two properties:

    1. A plaintext HTTP request to `weftspun-bao.internal:8200` is
       rejected (connection reset or TLS handshake error, not HTTP 200).
    2. A TLS request without a client cert, or with an expired cert,
       returns 403 (not 200).

    Both are negative controls. A gate that only checks "valid cert
    gets 200" passes when TLS is disabled entirely.
    """

    details "The 1Password `op item create` failure", ~S"""
    Three `op item create` calls during this session returned exit
    code 0 and printed item IDs:

    | returned ID                  | intended content         |
    |------------------------------|--------------------------|
    | jw6rvt6zvfbb7hrxfkdwp5cdg4  | FDB CA private key       |
    | 4jzyphsx2w64gvr2m475sm4f4q  | bao KV tls-anchor backup |
    | honp7pukafh4g62hycaa7anddm  | bao KV blobstore backup  |

    All three IDs return "isn't an item in any vault" on subsequent
    `op item get`. The `op item edit` call to existing item
    `d7fx6rayd6o43sie5joxinfyte` did persist; the difference is that
    `edit` updates an existing record while `create` allocates a new one,
    and the allocation silently fails when biometric authentication times
    out.

    This is the second loss of the FDB CA key. The first (RFD 2141)
    was a scratchpad cleanup; the second is a credential store that
    reported success without persisting.

    details "Decision", ~S"""
    Implemented 2026-09-01; see RFD 2146 for the role/policy map.

    Bao's PKI secrets engine becomes a standalone root CA for service
    auth. The FDB CA (`fdb-ca.chibifire.com`) stays separate for
    cluster mutual TLS.

    1. Mount `pki/` and generate a root CA inside bao.
    2. Issue a listener cert; enable TLS on `:8200`.
    3. Enable the TLS cert auth backend. Each service presents a client
       cert signed by bao's PKI and receives a scoped token for its
       KV paths.
    4. Elixir services use `libvault` (hex.pm) as the vault client.

    **Gate:** bao rejects a plaintext request to `:8200`.
    **Negative control:** a request with no client cert, or with an
    expired cert, returns 403.

    The FDB root CA key is lost a second time (the replacement from RFD
    2141 was stored via `op item create`, which returned an item ID but
    did not persist the item). Chaining under that CA is not possible
    without rotating FDB again.

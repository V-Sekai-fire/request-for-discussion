    decision ~S"""
    The pipeline is `atelier-workshop`, the deliverable that leaves it is `shuttle`. One word for each, used verbatim in RFD titles, changelogs, and public prose.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    The public tagline names two things: the pipeline that makes characters, and the deliverable that leaves it. "Workshop" alone was doing both jobs and reads as generic. `nx-shuttle` already uses "shuttle" (carrying a graph across to another runtime, weft-across-warp). Without a settled vocabulary, prose drifts between studio, pipeline, workshop, atelier.
    """

    section "Details", ~S"""
    - `atelier-workshop` (the pipeline). The compound keeps the elegance of the French loanword for readers who know it, and the plain-English gloss for those who do not. RFD 2136 (gacha ladder: 10-rung generation pipeline) is the concrete atelier-workshop.
    - `shuttle` (the portable-character deliverable), a portable VRM at rung 6 of RFD 2136. Retained without change; `nx-shuttle` already uses it for the same weft-across-warp metaphor. The two uses do not conflict: one shuttles a character out, the other shuttles a graph across.
    
    Never use `atelier` alone in shipping prose (loanword, pretentious without the gloss). `Workshop` alone is permitted where context already fixes it (the 2021 `character-workshop` decision doc stays).

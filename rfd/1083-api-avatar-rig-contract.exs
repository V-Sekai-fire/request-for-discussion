    decision ~S"""
    One canonical spec, this document (mirrored at
    `3DAIGC-API/docs/API_AVATAR_RIG_CONTRACT.md`, kept in lockstep), for
    every skinned humanoid GLB export: Y-up, -Z forward, feet on the
    floor, applied transforms, hips near mid-torso height. Both sides
    log `[API-Contract] PASS` or `FAIL`. The API fails the job outright
    on a critical code (upside down, facing backward, no skinned mesh,
    too few joints); the client applies only targeted skinned-mesh
    repair, and never reuses VRM-loader flags on an AIGC GLB, since a
    VRM upload and an AIGC rig follow deliberately separate paths (RFD
    1104 gives the VRM side).

    See `DETAILS.md` for the coordinate system, the full requirement and
    failure-code tables, the Blender export steps, and the retest
    procedure.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    An upside-down rig, a backward-facing character, and a rig
    floating at the hips were real, repeated regressions from the
    Blender export path. Two sides, the client and the DGX API, each
    validated a rigged GLB independently, with no shared spec, so a fix
    on one side could still drift from the other.
    """

    related ~S"""
    RFD 1084 gives the avatar pipeline that produces the GLB this
    contract validates. RFD 1104 gives the separate, contract-free VRM
    upload path.

    details "Export requirements", ~S"""
    1. A skinned mesh, at least one skin, 40 or more joints for a humanoid template rig.
    2. Applied transforms: armature and mesh transforms baked (`export_apply=True`).
    3. One coordinate space for mesh vertices and joint rest positions.
    4. Upright: spine above hips (client check), head above feet (API glTF check).
    5. Forward: character forward aligns with -Z.
    6. Vertical co-location: mesh and bone centers within roughly 35% of mesh height.
    7. Hips at torso: hips near 52% ± 15% of mesh height (client), or 25-70% from the feet (API).
    8. Feet on floor: foot bones and mesh feet share the same ground plane (client check).

    Severity split: the API fails a job only on a critical code

    `missing_skinned_mesh`, `insufficient_joints`). Advisory codes still
    appear in `rig_info.validation.codes` and

    fires in the viewport, a stricter second check after download.

    The DGX template rig should export a GLB in the same coordinate
    frame as `template.vrm`
    (`humanoid_template_id: "template"` maps to
    `assets/example_autorig/template.vrm`). A contract violation means
    the Blender export step drifted from that reference; fix it on the
    DGX, never by reusing VRM loader flags on VRM files.

    ### The template-rig Blender path

    `3DAIGC-API/scripts/blender/apply_humanoid_template_rig.py`:

    1. Uniform-scale from the armature's bone span to the target mesh height (Blender Z-up, after the glTF import).
    2. Yaw or flip the armature to face glTF -Z, before parenting; this step must not rotate the skinned mesh.
    3. Move the foot bones to the mesh floor (the minimum Z, in Blender).
    4. Center on Blender's XY ground plane.
    5. Envelope the skin, then export the GLB with `export_apply=True`.

    Do not align on Blender's Y axis for height; that caused the
    inverted rigs found in June 2026. Do not yaw the armature after
    parenting; that rotates the mesh away from the upload, also found
    in June 2026.
    """

    details "Validation timing, client side", ~S"""
    1. Pre-process: the raw GLB, right after load, before `processModel`'s scale and ground step.
    2. Post-viewport-layout: after that scale and ground step.

    Grep the remote log for `[API-Contract]`.
    """

    details "Retest", ~S"""
    1. Hard-reload this project.
    2. Run "Avatar from Image" as a new job.
    3. Grep the remote log for `[API-Contract] PASS`.
    4. Confirm an upright mesh and skeleton, in both Solid and Skeleton view modes.

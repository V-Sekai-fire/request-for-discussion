    details "Decision", ~S"""
    Green-lit; C++ and Rust both to ship.

    Ship two `.elf` implementations, both cross-compiling today, both
    loading into godot-sandbox unchanged.

    1. **C++**; reuses godot-sandbox's SafeGDScript build recipe.
    2. **Rust**; `cargo build --target riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu`.

    Different type systems, different memory models, different codegen ;
    bugs don't correlate. Both must agree on RFD 2157's fixture set
    byte-for-byte; disagreement is a soundness bug flagged against
    whichever impl differs from the Lean spec's reference output.

    `DETAILS.md` carries the differential harness, fixture format, and
    the spec-to-impl obligation table.

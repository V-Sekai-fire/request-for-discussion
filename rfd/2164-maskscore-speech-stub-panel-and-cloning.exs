    feature "MaskScore Speech stub filled along two axes -- a panel of\ndiverse ASR judges (12 tracks per audio) and a 10-rank ladder of\nvoice-cloned candidates. Together they cover the transcript and audio\ndimensions the reward model needs to score."

    scope "`6-datasource/anny-render-corpus`"

    decision ~S"""
    Panel is 7 tracks today per RFDs 2179, 2180, 2181 (Whisper,
    gemma-auto, allosaurus-rus drops); RFD 1102 (task catalog) is the
    live source. The 12-track sub-rung below is the as-shipped roster,
    kept for the retraction record.

    Sub-rungs (each a citable OID under this serial):

      .1    12-track ASR panel: parakeet, whisper, voxtral, wav2vec2,
            gemma-auto + gemma-gbnf, voxtral-ipa, ipa-whisper-s/b,
            allosaurus universal/eng/rus. See `emit_10track_panel.py`,
            `add_allosaurus_control.py`.
      .2.1  10 voice clones per audio via Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base:
            identity, pitch/tempo perturbation gradient, wrong content,
            wrong subject. See `voice_clone_10rank.py`.
      .2.2  Real different-speaker reference for rank9/10 using sub_1
            SpeakingFaces clips with `x_vector_only_mode=True`.
      .3    Score wavlm-cos + voxtral-WER on 150 clones (see
            `score_voice_clones.py`); rescore after .2.2 lands.
      .4    Emit Speech-stub parquets in ETNF three-file form.
      .5    Commit, push, HF upload, PR.

    Panel judges order by canonical-closeness; cloning ranks by
    similarity to reference audio; both feed one MaskScore gradient.

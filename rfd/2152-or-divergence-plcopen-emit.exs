    decision ~S"""
    Cover the single-branch OR case first (the blocks_world `get:
    pickup_from_table | unstack` shape), then multi-branch, then multi-
    step branches. Each branch becomes an SFC alternative sequence
    between an `OrDivergence` connector and an `OrConvergence` connector,
    with **mutually exclusive receptivities** enforced at emit time.
    A chart with overlapping receptivities is what RFD 2149's Lean
    analyser flags as a concurrent pair; the emitter reads that flag on
    the source compact GRAFCET and refuses if the pair appears.
    
    **Parked.** No taskweft caller needs OR-divergence in an OpenPLC
    target today. The lower/raise pair already covers OR on the HTN side
    (RFD 2148 test); this RFD closes only the PLCopen leg.
    
    `DETAILS.md` carries the PLCopen XML shape, the exclusivity gate, the
    interaction with RFD 2149, and multi-step branch semantics.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    RFD 2148's compact GRAFCET carries `|>` (OR-divergence) and `|<`
    (OR-convergence) markers; `Taskweft.Grafcet.lower/1` already lowers
    them to a synthesised chooser method (RFD 2148 stage 1). The PLCopen
    SFC emitter refuses them today with `RuntimeError` pointing here.

    details "The PLCopen XML shape", ~S"""
    IEC 61131-3 SFC's OR-divergence is a *simultaneous divergence* whose
    outgoing transitions have mutually exclusive receptivities. In
    PLCopen TC6 XML the shape is:
    
        <step localId="10" name="find">...</step>
        <transition localId="11">
          <connectionPointIn refLocalId="10"/>
          <connectionPointOut refLocalId="20"/>
          <condition><inline><FBD>... pickup_from_table branch's guard ...</FBD></inline></condition>
        </transition>
        <transition localId="12">
          <connectionPointIn refLocalId="10"/>
          <connectionPointOut refLocalId="21"/>
          <condition><inline><FBD>... unstack branch's guard ...</FBD></inline></condition>
        </transition>
        <step localId="20" name="pickup_from_table">...</step>
        <step localId="21" name="unstack">...</step>
        ... each branch's tail ...
        <transition localId="30">
          <connectionPointIn refLocalId="last_of_pickup"/>
          <connectionPointOut refLocalId="40"/>
        </transition>
        <transition localId="31">
          <connectionPointIn refLocalId="last_of_unstack"/>
          <connectionPointOut refLocalId="40"/>
        </transition>
        <step localId="40" name="mark_done">...</step>
    
    Two things distinguish OR-divergence from AND-divergence in the XML:
    
    1. `AndDivergence` in the compact form emits *one* transition with
       multiple `connectionPointOut` elements (fires all branches at once).
       OR-divergence emits *N* transitions, each with its own guard and
       its own single successor.
    2. The convergence side: `AndConvergence` emits one transition with
       multiple `connectionPointIn`s (fires when all branches complete).
       `OrConvergence` emits N transitions each with a single
       `connectionPointIn`, all pointing at the same merged step.
    
    FBD inline bodies apply as everywhere else per RFD 2150 (ST and LD
    blocklisted).
    """

    details "The mutually-exclusive-receptivity gate", ~S"""
    An OR-divergence whose branch receptivities are not mutually
    exclusive is a design defect: two branches fire at once, the SFC
    enters a state IEC 60848 does not specify, and the runtime's
    behaviour is implementation-defined. RFD 2149's Lean analyser flags
    this as a concurrent pair (the two branch steps co-occur in some
    reachable marking). The emitter reads that flag on the source
    compact GRAFCET before emitting; if any pair of branches from the
    same OR block appears, `emit/1` refuses with a pointer at the pair.
    
    **This turns the analyser from advisory into a load-time gate**, which
    is what RFD 2149 promised. RFD 2152 lands the interlock the promise
    implied.
    """

    details "Multi-step branches", ~S"""
    A branch with more than one step (`|> A → B → C |<`) needs a linear
    sub-chain per branch, and only the *last* step of the sub-chain
    connects to the OR-convergence. The stage 1 emitter refuses
    multi-step branches; stage 2 admits them once the walker in
    `lib/taskweft/openplc/plcopen.ex` can nest, mirroring what
    `Taskweft.Grafcet.lower/1`'s OR block tracking already does.
    """

    details "Interaction with the HTN lower", ~S"""
    `Taskweft.Grafcet.lower/1` already synthesises `m_choose_after_<parent>`
    methods with per-branch checks for OR blocks (RFD 2148 stage 1). The
    PLCopen emitter reads the *source* compact GRAFCET, not the lowered
    HTN, so this RFD does not touch `lower/1`. The two lower directions
    (HTN and PLCopen) stay independent, each with its own staging.
    """

    details "Verification", ~S"""
    1. `blocks_get_or.grafcet.jsonld` under `test/fixtures/grafcet/`
      emits an SFC with two mutually exclusive transitions out of `find`,
      two convergence transitions into `mark_done`, and no `<ST>` /
      `<LD>` / `<IL>` bodies (the BLOCKLIST rows still hold).
    2. A hand-authored non-exclusive fixture is refused by the emitter
      with the offending pair cited.
    3. The emitted XML validates against the PLCopen TC6 schema.
    """

    details "Staging within this RFD", ~S"""
    | stage | scope |
    |---|---|
    | 1 | single-step branches, mutually exclusive receptivities, `|>` and `|<` markers, blocks_world's `get` fixture |
    | 2 | multi-step branches (linear sub-chains between markers) |
    | 3 | nested OR blocks (`|>` inside `|>`) |
    | 4 | mixed OR + AND divergence in the same chart |
    
    The staging matches RFD 2148's own; each stage ships with its own
    round-trip test in `test/taskweft/openplc/plcopen_test.exs` and its
    own refusal control (a chart that would need the *next* stage fails
    with a pointer at that stage).

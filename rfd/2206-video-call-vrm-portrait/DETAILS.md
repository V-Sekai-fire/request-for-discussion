# RFD 2206 details: Video-call VRM portrait convention

## Amendment 2026-09-05: runtime swap to Godot `platform=web`

The portrait originally shipped as `@pixiv/three-vrm` in
`7-service/service-sqlar-cas/docs/vrm.js`. Per [RFD 2210](../2210-atelier-godot-web-shipping-surface/)
(L3) and [RFD 2216](../2216-threejs-blocklist/) (three.js blocklist),
the three-vrm path is retired. VRM 1.0 loading now happens via
[RFD 2213](../2213-vrm-via-godot-sandbox-elf/), `V-Sekai/godot-vrm`
compiled to a RISC-V ELF loaded by `modules/sandbox` (libriscv)
inside a Godot `platform=web` export.

The convention this RFD carries (video-call framing, LookAt on
camera, breathing/blink idle, reaction blendshapes, no world
navigation) stays the same. The runtime that renders the portrait
moves from three-vrm-in-a-browser-canvas to Godot-in-a-browser-
canvas. VRM asset (`SK_VRM1_Constraint_Twist_Sample`) unchanged.

The retracted-shape section below still holds, it retracted the
world-navigation input handlers regardless of runtime. Everything
below that references three-vrm specifically applies to how the
convention was implemented, not how it's implemented today; treat
those references as historical.

## The retracted shape

Before this convention landed, `docs/vrm.js` carried:

- WASD / arrow-key handlers driving `avatar.pos.x, z`.
- Pointer-lock mouse look driving `orbit.yaw, pitch`.
- Mouse-wheel zoom driving `orbit.dist`.
- Gamepad L-stick / R-stick reads for the same three targets.
- A camera pose derived per frame from `orbit.*` around a target
  parented to the avatar's chest.

That shape reads naturally for a *scene* (a character walking a
world), and it read wrong for a *dialogue* (a character talking
to the player through a phone-shaped frame). Nothing about the
handlers was buggy, they applied inputs faithfully. The
convention is a signal to the character (the player is holding
still and listening) not a limitation on the inputs.

## The reference implementation

`docs/vrm.js` after the retarget:

- Camera constructed once at boot; parent is `null` (world-space
  pinned) rather than the avatar's head bone. Head-bone-parenting
  was tried and rejected: it slid on breathing sway and read as
  the room shaking, not the character breathing.
- `applyLookAt(now)` reads the head-bone world position each
  frame, offsets +0.55 m along the character's forward axis at
  +0.02 m Y (eye height offset), and writes the camera position.
  Cheap; runs before the render call.
- `applyGlanceAway(now)` maintains one piece of state, the epoch
  of the next glance, and briefly targets a point offset from the
  camera by ~0.25 m along the character's right or up axis (uniform
  random each cycle). Duration 300 ms. Next glance scheduled 4-7 s
  out.
- `applyBreathing(now)` writes a small rotation on `Spine` and
  `UpperChest`, 0.02 rad amplitude, 4 s period. Amplitude and
  period were picked by eye; larger read as swaying, smaller
  wasn't visible.
- `applyBlink(now)` fires the expressionManager `blink` at ~4 s
  period with a 100 ms held-closed window. `@pixiv/three-vrm`'s
  built-in blink cycler was declined because it uses the same
  hook and adding two blinkers is hard to debug.
- `fireReaction(kind)` sets `expressionManager` `happy` /
  `neutral` / `sad` to 1.0, then a per-frame decay drops it back
  to 0 over the next ~1.6 s. The window is deliberately short:
  Starforged play surfaces a menu after each reaction, and a
  facial expression that holds past the next menu confuses the
  next beat.

## Diorama backdrops

Loaded once at scene start via three.js `GLTFLoader`. Static; no
animation. Swap per-scene by unloading the current backdrop and
loading a new one. Small target: any single backdrop under ~500 KB.
The Starforged demo ships `scenes/{cockpit,station-bar,deckplate}.gltf`
as reference set.

## Verification

- The Playwright script at `7-service/service-sqlar-cas/scripts/qa_demo.mjs`
  asserts:
 , `vrm.expressionManager.getValue('happy') > 0` within 200 ms of
    a strong-hit;
 , `vrm.expressionManager.getValue('happy') < 0.05` at 2000 ms
    after (reaction has decayed);
 , the camera position is unchanged across 10 s of idle (no
    world-navigation input reaches the camera).
- **Negative control** (rule 2): the test suite includes a
  scripted keyboard event dispatching WASD; the camera position
  MUST remain unchanged. A revision that reintroduces the WASD
  handler fails this assertion loudly.

## Trademark note

The convention is inspired by a genre of consumer video-calling
apps that share the same framing (eye-level, portrait 4:5,
head-and-shoulders composition). The RFD describes the shape by
its generic vocabulary and does not name any specific app or
platform. See CLAUDE.md's "Trademarks Stay Out of Shipping
Artifacts" clause.

This RFD was drafted by an AI and read by a human before it shipped.

## Decision

A VRM presented as an interlocutor is staged as **a 3D character in
a small diorama, framed like a video call**. The frame is fixed;
the character animates within it; there is no world navigation.
Concretely:

1. **Camera.** Eye-level (Head bone Y, ~1.52 m off the floor for
   an adult VRM, about the height of an adult wrist reached
   overhead), offset ~0.55 m along Z (about eight stacked AA
   batteries), no downward pitch. Targets a point just below the
   eyes so head + shoulders + up-to-the-ribcage fill the frame.
   Portrait 4:5 aspect (phone-call-native).
2. **LookAt.** The VRM's `LookAt` target follows the camera every
   frame via `godot-vrm`'s `VRMTopLevel` LookAt proxy (loaded as a
   sandbox ELF per [RFD 2213](../2213-vrm-via-godot-sandbox-elf/)).
   The player IS the caller. A small time-based glance-away every
   4-7 s for ~300 ms (about the width of a pencil of time) prevents
   the death-stare failure mode.
3. **Idle motion.** Ambient sway on `Spine` / `UpperChest` at 0.02
   rad amplitude with a 4-s sinusoid for breathing. Blink cycle
   ~4 s period with 100 ms closed.
4. **Reactions.** A move outcome (`strong-hit` / `weak-hit` /
   `miss`) fires a VRM expression blendshape (`happy` / `neutral`
   / `sad`) that holds for ~1.5 s then decays over ~100 ms back to
   neutral. Total envelope ~1.6 s, about the width of a golf ball
   of time. Reuses the VRM expression node `godot-vrm` exposes.
5. **Diorama backdrop.** A low-poly scene-flavored backdrop behind
   the character, swappable per-scene from a small `scenes/*.gltf`
   set. Kept deliberately low-detail so the character reads as the
   subject.
6. **What is banned.** No WASD, no arrow-key movement, no
   pointer-lock mouse look, no wheel zoom, no gamepad stick reads,
   no `avatar.pos` mutation, no `orbit.yaw / pitch / dist` camera
   state. A demo that presents a VRM as an interlocutor and lets
   the player fly the camera around it undoes the convention.

## Problem

The reflex-executor demo that shipped in
`7-service/service-sqlar-cas/docs/` first framed its VRM as an
inhabitant of a scene, WASD, orbit camera, gamepad. The Starforged
retarget of the same page kept the WASD wiring alive, and the
character read as a doll on a stage rather than as the person the
player was talking to. The retarget was a *decision-point* game
where the player is in dialogue with a character; the video-call
frame is what makes that reading legible without any extra prose.
This RFD writes that legibility down as a convention future
character-facing demos default to.

## Non-goals

Not a convention for third-person action, exploration, or world
demos, those keep their world navigation. Not a rig spec (the
underlying VRM is unchanged). Not a scene-content spec (dioramas
are per-demo; only that they exist and stay low-detail is
mandated).

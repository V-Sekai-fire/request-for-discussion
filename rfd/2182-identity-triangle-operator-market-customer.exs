    description: When writing about who runs the atelier-workshop, who receives the shuttle, or which market the workspace competes in, use these three anchors. Operator is chibifire.com (K. S. Ernest (iFire) Lee). Partner project is V-Sekai (iFire is a V-Sekai co-founder per the 2020-06-08 charter). Market is avatar-first social VR. Never name third-party social-VR trademarks; use generic vocabulary per CLAUDE.md.

    details "The triangle", ~S"""
    - Operator: `chibifire.com` (K. S. Ernest (iFire) Lee, github.com/fire). Owns the atelier-workshop; ships the shuttle.
    - Partner project: V-Sekai (charter at `V-Sekai/manuals-vsk/decisions/20200608-vsekai-charter.md`). iFire is a founding team member; the shuttle enters V-Sekai because both projects share the same intent: open, self-hosted, remixable social VR.
    - Market: avatar-first social VR. Generic vocabulary per CLAUDE.md; no third-party social-VR trademarks in shipping prose.

    Canonical positioning: chibifire operates an atelier-workshop that shuttles characters into V-Sekai, its partner project in the avatar-first social-VR market.
    """

    details "Purposes (Ibuka-shape, under V-Sekai's charter)", ~S"""
    1. Make portable characters other people can take away; the deliverable is data, not a service.
    2. Walk the gacha ladder (RFD 2136: 10-rung generation pipeline) rung by rung; each stage measurable in isolation.
    3. Score edits by reconstruction (MaskScore, RFD 1173 edit-reward corpus), not intent.
    4. Run on owned local compute only. Nothing rented.
    5. License-clean provenance: `.cff` beside every payload.

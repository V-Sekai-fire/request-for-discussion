    decision ~S"""
    Gemma-4-12B (QAT Q4_0, Apache-2.0) is the shared VLM: it serves both
    the avatar's text+image reasoning path and, as EditScore's fine-tune
    base (RFD 1157), the reward model that scores its own generations.
    Wan-VACE fills the image-generation slot Gemma leaves open. Audio
    arrives from RFD 1170's presence loop.

    MaskScore constructs edit triples by masking, reconstructing, and
    scoring decoded outputs. The reward model RL fine-tunes generators via EditScore.

    """

    problem ~S"""
    A real-time avatar needs a text+image reasoning core that doubles as
    the reward model for its own outputs. The audio path is separate per
    RFD 1170. EditScore is functionally complete in the NAND-gate sense:
    every generation task reduces to an edit, so one reward covers every
    modality.

    details_preamble ~S"""
    The target is Gemma-4-12B as the shared VLM. Two roles sit on the
    same weights: the avatar's text+image reasoning core, and the reward
    model that scores the model's own generations via the EditScore
    fine-tune (RFD 1157). Audio is a separate stack per RFD 1170's
    presence loop (Qwen3-ASR-1.7B for input, Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-
    CustomVoice for output). Shared weights are what close the MaskScore
    loop.
    """

    details "Gemma-4-12B (the shared VLM)", ~S"""
    google/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-q4_0-gguf. Apache 2.0, open weights, dense
    (not MoE), text and image input, text output. Ships as a true QAT
    Q4_0 checkpoint (~7 GB) directly from Google, so QAFT is upstream
    rather than something this workspace has to produce (RFD 1027's
    QAFT-first rule; RFD 2139's survey established Gemma is the only
    current-stack model with a true QAFT release). Fits 24 GiB with
    plenty of activation headroom.
    
    EditScore (RFD 1157) fine-tunes on top of Gemma, so the same base
    weights serve the avatar's understanding path and the reward model
    that scores its own generations. The share-backbone argument
    survives the Qwen3-VL -> Gemma-4-12B swap because it turns on
    share-backbone, not on which backbone: the reward model IS the base
    VLM under a fine-tune, not a separate model.
    
    The audio path is orthogonal and lives in RFD 1170: Qwen3-ASR-1.7B
    on device for input, Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice on host for
    output. Neither passes through the VLM.

    details "Wan-VACE (image and video generation)", ~S"""
    **Gemma-4-12B does not generate images.** Its outputs are text; it
    takes images as input but produces none. Wan-VACE fills the image
    and video generation slot Gemma leaves open. ~14B params, ~28 GB
    bf16, ~8.7 GB NF4.
    
    Wan-VACE is the generator that produces the images the 3D stage consumes
    and the images MaskScore's image-editing stubs edit and score.
    """

    details "Pixal3D→VoxHammer (the 3D stage)", ~S"""
    Wan-VACE generates and edits images and video; the 3D stage turns
    those images into meshes. Pixal3D produces a coarse textured mesh
    from an image, VoxHammer refines it. Gemma-4-12B Q4_0 (~7 GB) leaves
    ~17 GiB of the 3090's budget for the 3D stage; with Wan-VACE NF4
    (~8.7 GiB) swapped in for generation and out for the 3D stage, total
    peak occupancy is ~15.7 GiB.

    details "EditScore evaluation", ~S"""
    EditScore/EditReward-Bench: 2,890 samples across 12 task types and 3
    dimensions, each carrying an input image, an edit instruction, and
    multiple scored output images. The benchmark evaluates image editing
    quality: how well the edit follows the instruction while preserving
    unmodified regions.
    
    EditScore/EditScore-Reward-Data: 97,300 training samples for reward
    models that score edit quality.

    """

    details "MaskScore self-supervised training", ~S"""
    MaskScore extends EditScore to all modalities via latent masking. Mask a
    region of a latent, reconstruct with the stage's denoiser, decode both
    original and reconstruction, score the decoded output. The original is
    the ground truth. No human annotation needed.
    
    SpeakingFaces (CC-BY-4.0, 142 subjects, 13k+ instances) provides
    cross-modal ground truth: synchronized visual (768×512) and audio at
    nine camera angles. The ANNY canonical rig fitted to video frames
    recovers keypoints and SOMA bone poses (77 rotation vectors as Kimodo
    emits them, plus root translation and a root identity anny prepends at
    index 0 to reach the 78 pose parameters anny takes at call time, both
    counts true at different levels of the stack, per
    anny/test/test_soma.py:242-283 and task #76's back-port; the fitted
    poses are directly consumable by any downstream that accepts Kimodo
    output, without running Kimodo itself). MoGe-3 produces metric
    depth maps from the visual frames; Pixal3D encodes images to voxel
    grid latents via the sparse structure VAE.
    
    This gives (face image, depth, keypoints, pose, waveform) tuples per
    synchronized frame, with voxel grids produced downstream by Pixal3D
    from the image rather than from the ANNY fit.
    
    The four-stage loop:
    
    1. Mask→reconstruct (denoiser pretraining, reconstruction loss)
    2. Score decoded outputs (LPIPS, Chamfer, UTMOS, BLEU; all automated)
    3. Train reward model on automated scores
    4. RL fine-tune with reward model

    Gemma-4-12B Q4_0 (~7 GB) is Google's own QAT release. On the 3090's
    24 GiB, Gemma-4-12B Q4_0 + Wan-VACE NF4 co-resident totals ~15.7
    GiB, comfortable, no workspace-side quantization required.
    
    An earlier draft named Qwen3-VL-4B (fp16 ~8.9 GB) as the VLM; the
    Qwen3-VL-8B fp16 fallback (~16 GB) was also on the shortlist. Both
    retracted per RFD 2169. The reason is not tier, Qwen3-VL fits --
    it is that Gemma-4-12B has a true upstream QAFT release and Qwen
    does not, and the workspace standardized on QAFT-first (RFD 1027).
    """

    details "Why not LLaDA", ~S"""
    LLaDA-o NF4 on the 3090 produced 64 tokens in 5.76 s at steps=128,
    25x slower than the RFD 1170 presence-loop sub-500ms target. Block
    diffusion iterates to convergence across the full block; an
    autoregressive VLM streams from the first forward pass. The family
    (LLaDA-o, iLLaDA, LLaDA-1.5) is blocklisted. The MaskScore technique transfers to Gemma-4-12B (or any VLM)
    without change. Masking operates on latents, not on the model that
    fills them.
